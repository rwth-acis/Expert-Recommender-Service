Two years ago, I was able to run 10 miles no prob.  After getting married and in school full time I haven't ran for a while.  I went running the other day, and had the same feeling.  I'm no Doctor or health expert, but I'm assuming that working out your lungs and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livestrong.com/article/22608-breathing-exercises-increase-lung-capacity/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;lung capacity&lt;/a&gt; is the same as working out your other muscles.  It takes time, and pain to get stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some excercises that you can do to build up your lung capacity:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Belly Breath Exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This belly breath exercise is designed to deepen your breathing and increase your overall energy levels. Lie down on the ground with a pillow behind your head and your back flat on the ground. Put one of your hands down on your stomach and push till you have pushed down on your diaphragm. According to UMKC, pushing down on your diaphragm helps to draw additional air into your lungs. From here, take a slow deep breath and don't stop inhaling until you have reached full capacity. Exhale and repeat this belly breathing exercise for one minute. After one minute, rest for one minute before repeating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standing Breathing Exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This standing breathing exercise is designed to improve lung capacity and help people with respiratory illnesses. Stand up straight with your legs shoulder width apart. From here, relax your knees and bend your upper torso down over your body. As you bend your upper torso, exhale deeply to remove all air that is currently found within your lungs. After you have released the air, stand up straight and take in a deep breath of air. From here, hold this breath for 15 to 20 seconds. While you are holding your breath, stretch your arms out over your head to maximize lung capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher Altitude Running Exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This exercise is designed to help you increase lung capacity by training at higher altitudes. Find a mountain or place that has a high elevation and prepare to run. Prior to running, stretch out for 10 to 15 minutes, acclimating yourself to the new altitude and weather. From here, run for 30 minutes to an hour, making sure that you are keeping pace with your normal running routine. Higher altitude training increases lung capacity because of an increase in red blood cells and haemoglobin found in your body. Because a higher altitude reduces the amount of available oxygen in the atmosphere, your body compensates by increasing the concentration of red blood cells in your body. This is ideal for athletes looking to temporarily increase their lung capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livestrong.com/article/204281-exercises-for-lung-capacity/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reference site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="30" LastEditorUserId="30" LastEditDate="2011-03-01T20:09:37.843" LastActivityDate="2011-03-01T20:09:37.843" CommentCount="0" />

Besides, speed is of no relevance when building up your fitness, so it's literally a waste of energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try running at a speed that you can still talk&lt;/strong&gt;, because your breathing frequency (and thus ability to speak) and your VO2Max (your capacity for exercise) are very strongly related. The speed at which you can still speak is mostly a speed at which you're performing aerobic exercise. If you run any faster, you start to create more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than your body can get rid off, which is what you want to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try to run with a buddy&lt;/strong&gt;, because you have somebody to talk to during running and someone who can keep you motivated when things start to get tougher (and vice versa).

Old shoes have degraded EVA, which has bad or inconsistent cushioning. Using your aerobics or tennis shoes for running is also a bad idea, because while they may look similar, they are really built completely different and often of different material as well. Getting a pair of good running shoes will go a long way of reducing your chances of injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If all else fails, you could get a pair of orthotics (don't overpay!) or compression stockings. The first helps reduce movement of your foot in the shoe or make slight corrections to your feet roll off pattern. The latter keeps your calf muscle in place and thereby reduces the stress on the soft tissue &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last part I can really recommend: &lt;strong&gt;get a training plan&lt;/strong&gt;.

So instead of aiming to run at 10 km/h start out at 8 km/h, instead of trying to run for half an hour, start with 20 minutes. Also, I can really recommend a program like Start to Run or your C25K, this forces you to alternate between walking and jogging for at least the first few weeks. This greatly reduces the total stress on your soft tissue and should give your body time to start adapting. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But remember, even when things start to get better, stick to your plan!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8" LastEditorUserId="8" LastEditDate="2011-03-01T21:26:40.667" LastActivityDate="2011-03-01T21:26:40.667" CommentCount="4" />

But jogging is characterized by going from bipedal to unipedal, so all the force is being applied to the one leg and thus one knee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/u4WFr.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Fancy graph that explains nothing...&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You're perfectly capable of walking, so what you are looking for is a speed at which the forces on your knees are higher than during walking, but not as high as during running.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What's also important is to reduce the moment arm your bodies center of mass has towards your knee.

So in short, my opinions are fairly biased, but by no means scientifically proven.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While md5sum names some great rules of thumb, they apply to every shoe and don't help you determine what type of shoe you're looking for. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First a short note: Adidas did a study way back in 1987 and found that most injuries come from:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Injuries caused by training:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wrong intensity of training: 12%&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Too rapid increase in intensity: 9%&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Several others: 9%&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Injuries caused by shoes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bad quality of shoes: 17%&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wearing your shoes for too long: 11%&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrong kind of shoes&lt;/strong&gt;: 44%&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, picking the right kind of shoes is pretty darn important! &lt;strong&gt;So how do we pick one?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/yo6Cd.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dissection of a Saucony shoe&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you dissect a shoe, it's made up out of two main components: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the upper, which is the mesh, leather or synthetic material + the shoe laces;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the sole of the shoe, which can consist out of several layers&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first component is composed the same for nearly every pair of running shoe. While the last around which it is made, may or may not fit your foot (&lt;a href=&quot;http://fitness.stackexchange.com/questions/113/what-should-i-look-for-in-a-running-shoe/131#131&quot;&gt;see md5sum's answer for some excellent advise there&lt;/a&gt;), you won't find much variety within a certain brand. However, you should note that this is mostly true for the running shoes. &lt;strong&gt;Don't even consider running on those cheaper aerobic or tennis models&lt;/strong&gt;, because you'll fall in the trap Adidas found earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other component, which is the sole of the shoe. Now when I say sole, I'm actually referring to everything that is below your foot when you're inside the shoe. Trying to discuss all the bits and pieces that compose it depends strongly on the brand and their design-department.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When limiting choices towards endurance running and excluding fancier shoes that are meant for trail running or sprinting on a track. &lt;strong&gt;You're left with a shoe sole that serves several functions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;offer stability and control of motion,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;shock absorption and/or reduction,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;protection against the underground and overuse/strain,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;comfort,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;enhancing your performance&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shock absorption is mainly determined by your body weight, rather than the type of shoe. When you're lighter, you can get away with having a 'softer' (as in lower shore values) soles than when you're heavier. When I say shock absorption, don't immediately think: Nike Air! because most absorption comes from flexing your joints, rather than compressing your sole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several 'special' features for motion control, though you can safely assume that unless you have some severe disorder, you probably don't need any of the extreme models. With extreme, I mean shoes with extreme angles at the heel or other gimmicks:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/pkhBf.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're 'normal' &lt;strong&gt;you fall in one of three groups&lt;/strong&gt;: those who pronate too much, those who run neutral, those who don't pronate enough (or supinate). Don't mistake this for the other three types people like to call out: flat, normal arched and high arched feet. Hate to break it to them, but since the shoes all have the same shape on the inside, they surely aren't adapted to your arch! No I'm talking about biomechanics here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/4Maoq.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These pictures depict the maximal motion in this subjects ankle, that your running shoe is trying to limit. Funny enough, I almost never encounter shoes that help against eversion (supination), so choice boils down to: how much pronation do you have, ranging from excessive to normal?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This boils down to three main types of shoes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Heavy support shoes, you can recognize them by having a very straight last and the arch area is either entirely filled or there's antipronation support running from the back till the ball of the shoe. You can recognize this by its gray color or at least using a distinctive color difference between the inner (medial) and outer (lateral) side of the shoe.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Moderate anti-pronation shoes, these often only have the antipronation support in the heel area. Again, you can recognize this by the grey color.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Neutral shoes, these have no special features for reducing pronation (that the other two models don't have already).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how do I know which one I need?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well one easy way of determining this is looking back at your history:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You never had anti-pronation shoes and didn't sustain any injuries? --&gt; Get neutral shoes&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do you run a lot and for long distances? Neutral shoes&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You're not overweight? --&gt; Neutral shoes unless move point 3 applies. If not, more stable shoes&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Did you ever have any injuries that are linked to pronation? Get more stable shoes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're overweight and you have a history of pronation-related injuries then yes, probably you need the heaviest kind of support you can get. In most other cases, the neutral shoe is of such decent quality that you don't need anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So isn't there any choice at all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, yes all the brands will tell you they have superior technologies built into their shoes and they're all right. But sadly for them, that technology also has to fit your foot. When you take 5 different brands and you start to test them on a treadmill, you probably end up having to chose between two brands, because &lt;a href=&quot;http://fitness.stackexchange.com/questions/113/what-should-i-look-for-in-a-running-shoe/131#131&quot;&gt;the rest 'didn't feel right'&lt;/a&gt; and you end up picking the one with the fancy colors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do I do if I want to start with running and don't know what's good for me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Typically, it depends on many things, but any good running shop should be able to advise you based on your conditions. What's your posture, age, physique, level of activity, general health, your goals with running, training intensity etc...? But all in all, in most cases a good stable running shoe is more than sufficient. When you have a good shoe, the other factors from the Adidas study become more important: running too hard, on a too hard underground, for too long, far too often in a short amount of time will causes injuries no matter what shoes you wear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any final words?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Seasoned runners will generally disagree with my advice, but it isn't catered to them. Because if you're capable of running a lot and very often, chances are that natural selection decided you're a pretty good runner or else Mother Nature would have stopped you in your tracks long ago. This means that you get to wear lighter shoes or silly shoes like the Vibram ones, because you let your body do all the work. That's mainly where the performance enhancing comes from: leaving as much of the shoe out to not get in your way. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8" LastEditorUserId="15" LastEditDate="2011-03-02T00:19:10.377" LastActivityDate="2011-03-02T00:19:10.377" CommentCount="7" />

But as soon as you start to exercise, your metabolism kicks in and increases proportionally to your rate of work. But because burning fat happens too slow and requires a lot of oxygen (CO2) to burn, you gradually start to burn glycogen (CHO) instead. The relation between these two is pretty much inverse, which means that the harder you start working, the less fat and the more glycogen you start burning. All the while, your heart rate and oxygen uptake increase pretty much linearly. This phase is called the &lt;strong&gt;aerobic phase&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise&quot;&gt;&quot;with oxygen&quot;&lt;/a&gt;), because you have sufficient oxygen to burn both the fat and the glycogen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Until you start reaching a point where your cardiovascular (heart + vessels) or respiratory (lungs) system are starting to lag behind the required lung ventilation. This point is called your &lt;strong&gt;lactate threshold&lt;/strong&gt; and indicates that you're starting to accumulate too much lactate in your blood. Lactate is the by product of anaerobic glycolysis, because you burned the glycogen with insufficient oxygen. A second thing that happens is that your red blood cells get saturated with carbon dioxide (CO2), it can take up less oxygen to supply the muscles with 'fresh air'. The phase above the lactate threshold is the &lt;strong&gt;anaerboic phase&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/52Kke.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;a href=&quot;http://brendan-gray.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/VO2MaxLactate.png&quot;&gt;keep increasing the load from this point on&lt;/a&gt;, your body is starting to saturate and you're rapidly depleting your glycogen resources. Unless you're a highly trained athlete, these levels of exercise (80-90% of your maximal oxygen uptake) are generally hard to sustain for long periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as you can see a lot of factors are involved in determining your where your aerobic phase starts. Your heart has to be able to increase its heart rate and increase the blood pressure, your lungs have to ventilate old air out and new air in and transfer O2/CO2 with the blood, blood has to transfer O2/CO2 with both the lungs and the muscles and your muscles have to produce energy, contract and relax and transfer all the involved products.&#xA;And all these factors together determine your anaerobic capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is also dependent on how well you are trained. The more trained you are, the higher levels of lactate you can sustain, the more glycogen you have in your muscles or even the more blood you have (and many more).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how does this apply to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming your maximal heart rate lies at 200 bpm and you're working out at 170, that's 85% of your maximal capacity. My cynical guess is that your heart rate monitor is slightly off. One way of determining whether it's correct is trying your own VO2Max-test only without the actual oxygen testing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Follow a standard testing protocol to test how your heart rate increases when you incrementally increase the home trainers wattage until you can no longer sustain the load. That's a fair guess estimate of your real maximum and will give you an idea whether 170 bpm is around or above your lactate threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt; I greatly simplified several aspects, if you have any questions or find that I need to explain something, just leave a comment &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8" LastEditorUserId="104" LastEditDate="2011-11-28T00:31:47.903" LastActivityDate="2011-11-28T00:31:47.903" CommentCount="1" />

Instead of increasing strength, you're far more likely to overuse those muscles instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I agree with a lot of the arguments that are being made in the advantage of these shoes, but I would personally only recommend them to more seasoned runners and people without overweight or excessive pronation.

The other two points mainly exclude two high risk factors for getting injuries in the first place, so I wouldn't recommend them to experiment&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps everyone could wear them, but then I would advise them to start wearing gradually and preferably as much as possible. The advantage of this is that you give your body the time to adapt and strengthen the muscles to deal with running without 'support'.

You can do this by exercising under higher loads or working out longer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But fitness machines often fail at mimicking the natural increase in loads: on an elliptical trainer, when you increase the loads going 'round' get's harder everywhere. I've made a small model of the forces during an elliptical workout, when you increase the load from the light to the dark blue arrow, the forces get proportionally higher everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/3sjsg.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the problem is, when you're leg is stretched away from the center of your body, those 'small' forces have a large moment arm (towards the center of your body). So while it's not an issue for the forces to increase under your body, it because &lt;strong&gt;extra&lt;/strong&gt; hard when they increase far away from your body.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This causes it to be pretty hard to go faster and faster on your home trainer, even when your fitness increases. So that option is basically out, as there's almost no home trainer that doesn't make the same mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your other option is to workout longer, which happens to be a very good choice when you want to burn fat. Because burning fat happens mostly at lower intensities, so actually when you start to work out harder, your body shifts gear and moves away from fat to other 'faster' fuels. Therefore it would be better to burn 500 kcal at 60% of your maximal heart rate than at 80%, because at least you got rid of some fat! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/U4wIP.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's another reason why you need to work out longer: fat is a slow fuel and your body doesn't really start to burn fat until you're 30 minutes into a workout. Luckily, nobody said you had to workout hard to get to this point, so I'd advise you to use a long, relaxing 'warming up' just to get your metabolism going and then get going with the real deal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So basically: &lt;strong&gt;no, you don't need to go out and buy anything else!&lt;/strong&gt; But if you like some variation, I'd really recommend you to start running outdoors instead.

The big advantage of jogging is that it burns through calories like crazy and you're using a lot of different muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have a pool nearby, I would also recommend &lt;strong&gt;swimming&lt;/strong&gt;. During swimming you're using your arms in a totally different way than when working behind the desk. It also strengthens your arm and shoulder muscles, which hopefully let's you bear the stresses of working with stretched out arms all day. Especially focusing on backstroke is good, because when sitting behind the desk, you're 'exercising'/using your breast muscles more, so training the back muscles helps balance that. Furthermore, swimming is like a master-combo of all the arms movements anti-RSI campaigns make you do!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your commute isn't too long, you could &lt;strong&gt;cycle commute&lt;/strong&gt;. Ride your bike from home to work in the morning and from work to home at the end of the day. This is easiest in the summer when the days are longer and there's less rain, but possible all year. If there's a shower available at or near work you can cycle long and hard and then clean up, but if you go a bit slower you should be able to do it in regular clothes and just change your shirt and fix your hair when you get to work. If you're depending on exercise to get around it's harder to skip it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Doing a combination of &lt;strong&gt;multiple workouts&lt;/strong&gt; every other day keeps it fun, because you're not constantly doing the same.

Doing too much, too fast can cause injuries! Furthermore, working out very hard with a poor physical condition is almost a guarantee of having terrible muscle soreness the next day. If you have to endure that for several weeks: not very motivating! Instead of rushing to get fitter as quickly as possible, focus on getting in better shape gradually.

If you sit on the couch and don't eat, your body will consider muscle fair game since it isn't being used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Calorie reduction will also cause dehydration, and the further you reduce, the more severe the dehydration becomes. Be certain to drink all the pure, plain, unaltered water (I stress pure water) that you need. Drink water any time you feel thirsty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Talk to your doctor before you decide to do any diet, especially any form of extreme calorie reduction. Some doctors refuse to recommend extreme calorie reduction for patients, while others are fine with it, but at least ask about the risk specifically presented to your health, as your doctor will know your health history best.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be absolutely certain that you do not continue a calorie restrictive diet past the point of reaching your minimum healthy weight, or you will begin burning muscle. The muscle you will burn includes your internal organs such as your heart. Taking muscle from your organs is extremely hazardous to your health and can lead to long term or permanent damage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="21" LastActivityDate="2011-03-03T16:47:49.253" CommentCount="2" />

I destroyed the soles of my feet a few times by running with bad form and trying to do too much too soon, but they healed up surprisingly quickly :-)  ONE CANNOT PUT TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON GOING SLOWLY WITH BAREFOOT RUNNING!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eventually I bought a pair of Vibram Fivefinger KSOs and this made a huge difference.  I would start out running a short distance barefooted to help me with my form, then put on the Vibrams and run a mile or so.  Running in Vibrams made my feet sore for the first few weeks.  This was muscular soreness most noticeable when I got out of bed each morning and the muscles in my feet were stiff.  The soreness would go away after about five or ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eventually I stopped having sore feet and gradually worked my way up to a mile barefooted followed by three more in my VFFs - all on concrete and asphalt.  I still run this way and really enjoy it.  Last year I ran the last three miles of the Peachtree Road Race barefooted and it was hilarious.  I got quite a few comments :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now I consider myself to be a &quot;Natural Runner&quot;, running as I would run barefooted but using minimalist footwear to protect the soles of my feet from the friction of concrete and asphalt.  After running in VFFs for 5 years I am sure that I will never go back to traditional running shoes, though I also do not think barefooted running is practical if you are running on concrete and asphalt.  One can do it, but it would take me more than a year of committed effort to develop the necessary toughness in the soles of my feet to put in 15 or 20 miles a week this way.  These surfaces are just soooo abrasive!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From my current perspective, the notion that you would take a complex shock-absorbing structure like your foot and encase it in a shoe that filled-in the arch and presented a flat surface to the ground, then add shock-absorbing materials to the shoe and expect that to be &quot;better&quot; for your feet seems somewhat comical.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course that's just my opinion, I could be wrong :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One additional note:  if you are going to experiment with barefoot running, read the advice found &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunning.com/?page_id=109&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here on barefootrunning.com&lt;/a&gt;.  It is the best advice I found online. While it discusses the foot strike it does not put too much emphasis on it.  If you really try to &quot;land&quot; on your forefoot you will blister your foot.  Focus primarily on the other advice like landing with your feet under your hips and bending your knees more and lifting your whole foot rather than pushing off with your toes.  I find it helpful to think that I am placing my forefoot on the ground then shifting my weight to it.  Of course this happens very quickly and the effect feels more like landing on your whole foot, but your forefoot contacts the ground first then your foot and ankle absorb much of the impact compared to a heel strike.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:  03/20/2012 I just found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jrnj-7YKZE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; that gives a nice overview of why I decided to switch to minimalist and barefoot running.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:  09/04/2013 I added links to Harvard's Skeletal Biology Lab's Barefoot Running Website and modified a sentence to reflect that fact that, 5 years in, I will certainly never go back to traditional running shoes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:  04/22/2014 I added the last paragraph with the link to how to run naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="147" LastEditorUserId="147" LastEditDate="2014-04-22T19:42:08.853" LastActivityDate="2014-04-22T19:42:08.853" CommentCount="5" />

Many cities have various track clubs that are friendly to people who are less than lightning fast. However, that costs money, takes time, and may not be ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One activity that I used to learn a lot about my running style was setting up a video camera to record me running on a treadmill. I set up the treadmill to have me run in a couple of different ways, about the pace I use for my long slow runs and my &quot;racing pace&quot;, both with and without shoes. I then stepped through each of the videos frame by frame to get an idea for how my foot was hitting and rolling as I ran. Unfortunately, because the video was from the side, it made it hard judge whether or not my feet were actually hitting straight on and how far left or right they were. After watching each video in slow motion, I stepped through the shoe and barefoot videos side by side to understand how my kick was working and, more importantly, what sort of pressure I was putting on my feet while landing. It wasn't pretty and made it obvious why my knee hurt so much, with shoes I was hitting on my heel with my leg fully extended. There was nothing to absorb shock except my heel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using that information I've been paying extensive attention to my running form while on training runs -- regardless of whether or not I'm barefoot. Mainly this consists of making sure that I land further up on the ball of my foot with a slight bend in my leg and that my heel hits the ground after the ball of my foot. An easy way to tell if you've done this right is by listening to to the noise that your footfall makes. Landing on your forefoot is usually much quieter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This will, however, end up hurting your calves. It took me about four weeks before I was comfortable running with a forefoot strike without focusing on my food landing. My calves still haven't built up all the way, but that's coming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, I got the idea of recording my running from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrOgDCZ4GUo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;running analysis video by NJ Sports Medicine on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="169" LastActivityDate="2011-03-04T02:25:11.393" CommentCount="1" />

An avocado is a great example to get potassium. Also, bananas are great as well. Presumably unprocessed banana chips (dehydrated banana) would be a good start. Celery is also a good way to up your sodium levels. All of your electrolytes can be gotten from purely natural sources, and your body will absorb them slightly easier from these natural sources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The basic thing to remember is what your electrolytes are: sodium chloride, potassium, magnesium, and calcium.

In my own experience the butterfly stroke is by far the hardest to maintain for long distances. How you fill in your workout depends on two factors, how well can you swim and how hard do you want to be working out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How well can you swim?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have a poor technique or a poor condition, swimming will become quite heavy to sustain at a decent speed very quickly. The poor technique causes you to swim inefficient, because having a wrong posture creates a lot of unnecessary drag and inefficient breathing. The poor condition means fatigue will have a negative influence on both your speed and your technique. A combination of both will lead to a complete downward spiral.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should you care?&lt;/strong&gt; Well, the point is you want to be swimming for a long stretch off time, enough for some real cardio-exercise. You don't want to be 'wasting' energy and end up completely wasted half way through. You should only make it harder on yourself once yourself once you have a decent baseline condition. &lt;strong&gt;Pick the strokes that allow you to swim for as long as possible.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How hard do you want to be working out?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like running, swimming is something you can make as hard as you want to. If you swim faster, it will cost you more energy. You can also add tougher strokes (like butterfly stroke) or add resistance (wear a t-shirt or use paddles) to increase the resistance. The other option is working out longer, though unless your serious about swimming long distances, I reckon this is the last option for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should you care?&lt;/strong&gt; This means that if you always swim for half an hour and you're swimming condition + technique start to improve, you can either do more in those 30 minutes or add some minutes to make it harder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So say your already capable of swimming half an hour non-stop, what should you be doing? &#xA;As with every other workout, you can either try to swim faster (more miles/hour) and just swim non-stop or use interval training to push yourself harder during short stretches of time combined with periods of relative rest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For pushing yourself faster, I'd recommend the latter. Though you should always combine it with 'rest' days where you simply swim non-stop and perhaps focus on improving your technique rather than pushing for speed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A 'typical' swimming workout with intervals could consist out of a 400m warming up, it doesn't really matter what stroke you swim, just that you get your heart rate up to a nice and steady level. Then you start swimming 100/200m intervals, you have two options with how to approach these:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;swim freestyle as fast as possible &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swimsmooth.com/training.html&quot;&gt;without going over your lactate treshold&lt;/a&gt; and then rest. Depending on your condition you could take off every 1:45 or 2 min, this means the faster your swim the longer your allowed to rest. But don't over do yourself, you're not trying to break World Records here!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;swim freestyle with a certain time goal in your mind (not your fastest), then after the 100m swim backstroke or breaststroke for 50m. I prefer backstroke, because you train your back muscles which helps with some variation and more importantly, you can get to breath non-stop which is often the most important thing during your 'rest'.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could also try to focus on swimming faster for longer stretches of time. An often used method for this is using a 'pyramid' built up. It basically goes like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;100m --&gt; 200m --&gt; 300m --&gt; 400m --&gt; 300m --&gt; 200m --&gt; 100m&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which totals in 1600m (not bad!) + 400m of your warming up. Swim each interval as fast as possible (under the lactate threshold), but try to keep up a constant pace rather than ending very slow. This teaches you to spread your efforts when the workout starts to become longer and will help you find a pace of breathing and stroking that you can keep up for longer stretches of time. You can use the same protocol as with the 100m workouts, if you aim for 1:45 min with rest, just multiple that for every 100m you swim. This means your need to swim the 400m within 7 minutes and you get the rest of the time to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can shorten your 100m time, but you can also switch the resting for swimming 50m backstroke. This gives you less rest, but you don't have to push yourself to swim much faster (which is often much harder!). Alternatively, you could do a medley, where you combine all strokes. The recommended order is: butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, because it has a good mix of intensity and 'rest'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So my advice: &lt;strong&gt;always swim freestyle&lt;/strong&gt; unless you want some variation or rest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8" LastEditorUserId="8" LastEditDate="2011-03-05T17:48:05.157" LastActivityDate="2011-03-05T17:48:05.157" CommentCount="2" />

You only consume a couple percent of the 20% oxygen you breathe in, no the reason you breathe is to get rid of the CO2! So focus on exhaling as fast or powerfully as possible. With focus, I mean practice it regularly while swimming more slowly and really try to get rid of all the breath in your lungs as fast as possible. When you've exhaled, you're able to inhale again, so mastering exhaling gives you more flexibility in when you decide to inhale again (you never have to wait).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. When you're not breathing, keep your head still.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your head is like the steering wheel of your entire body, so keeping your face still, looking down means your body will have a steady posture too. If the swimming pool has lines on the bottom, it greatly helps to swim straight above, because it gives you a point of focus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Breathe &quot;in your armpit&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Swim Smooth puts it: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When you move through water you create a 'bow wave' with your head and body, just like a boat does. The shape of the bow wave means the water level drops along the side of the swimmer's face. This creates a trough either side of your head and body that is beneath the surface level of the pool - so there's air lower than you might expect there to be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Try to limit unnecessary movement, so simply rotate your head by moving your chin towards your armpit. Normally the trough created by your head should be large enough to allow your mouth to be just above the water, so you can breathe in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Don't lift your head.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you listened to my previous tip, you already knew you not supposed to lift your head, but simply rotate it. One important reason you don't want to lift your head is because it's very straineous on the back/neck muscles, but more importantly it causes your legs to sink lower! This slows you down and makes the swimming heavier, thus increases your need for air... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/BWfPj.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Don't over rotate your head.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A picture says more than a 1000 words, so here's another great example from Swim Smooth: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/KWTmg.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you rotate your head too far, remember your entire body is rotating with. This is bad for several reasons: your leg might be kicking near the surface of the water rendering it pretty much useless; your arm dives too deeply, making it heavier to lift out of the water again and your increasing your frontal surface within the water, which is also very bad!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. A lack of body rotating hurts your breathing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first reason for this one is obvious: if you rotate your body, you don't have to rotate your neck as much to be able to breathe. But there's more, so much actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swimsmooth.com/rotation.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;that Swim Smooth has a whole article about it that I highly recommend!&lt;/a&gt; Other than because you need it for a good technique, I think there's one important point:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/aKKiG.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those muscles are much more effective if you rotate slightly, because when lying face down, it means more strength would have to come from your breast muscles instead of the very strong back muscles. It also means you have to lift your arm higher out of the water when swinging it back forwards. But just as with over rotating your head, also don't over rotate your torso! Instead, read the article to see what you should be doing!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swimsmooth.com/bilateral.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Learn to breathe bilaterally.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This helps you create a symmetrical swimming technique, prevents over-using one side, gives you more flexibility to breath when you &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; to and it forces you to keep up a decent stroke frequency. The bilateral breathing forces you to rotate slightly from side to side (see previous point) and because you breathe every three strokes, if you make too long strokes you'll start to run out of air. That's how it forces you to optimize the length and speed of your strokes to find a ratio that fits you best.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how much should you be breathing?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That depends on how fast your swimming and how much oxygen you need. When sprinting you could be breathing at nearly every stroke, because you're in dire need of oxygen. But when you're swimming longer distances, your probably breathing every three strokes. This makes a great habit, because of the bilateral breathing, but also because it helps you find a good rhythm. If you can make 5 strokes before needing to breath, you're probably not swimming fast enough for a decent workout. If you need less than 3 strokes, you're probably swimming too fast or not breathing out enough (thus leaving some CO2 behind in your lungs!).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Exhaling should definitely be done while the face is submerged underwater, by doing this you are decreasing the amount of time that the face needs to be out of the water. When the face is out of the water it causes disruption to the streamlined position of the stroke and increases water resistance and drag, this decreases you're momentum. It also reduces your balance meaning you have to work harder. As well the longer your face is out of the water the more disruption to the rhythm of your stroke there is. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Breathing rate is completely dependent on what the individual finds comfortable. However, i do not agree with the earlier suggested patterns. Sprinters do not need to breathe as much. Sprinters rely on their anaerobic energy systems, meaning they do not require oxygen! Breathing, even when done so correctly disrupts the rhythm and momentum of the stroke. Sprinters rely solely on speed! They cannot afford too much disruption to their stroke of rhythm. If 25m can be swam without breathing then it should be done so, same with 50m, although unless at absolute elite level this is difficult. A pattern can be developed such as breathing every three strokes but since it is a sprint race something like every 7 stroke would be better suited. Alternatively, breathing every three or similar on the first 25m and then as little as possible on the second 25m is also ideal. 100m is still classed as a print race, but again presuming this is not a question for elitist athletes then breathing patterns should be similar to every three or five as with all classed middle distances. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As distance increases, so does the variation in breathing patterns. However we do normally see an increase in the breathing rate, this is so more oxygen can be consumed to prolong the onset of fatigue. I can go on about how each energy system works but the energy system which requires oxygen is the only one which does not cause fatigue, due to it not causing lactic acid. It is true that we still get fatigued when using the aerobic (oxygen) energy system but that is when our demand for energy becomes too much for this system to handle as we can not consume enough oxygen to cope with the demand and we begin to use the energy systems which do not require oxygen which produce fatiguing by-products- lactic acid.Quite often with very long distances such as 800m and 1500m, many elitist performers breathe every other stroke for the majority of the race but then reduce their breathing rate as they enter the final, sprint stages of the race. Breathing can also become tactical, such as Ian Thorpe who breathes out of only one side, not arm. This enables him to keep an eye on who he considers to be his main competitor throughout the whole race. Breathing bilaterally does produce a more rounded stroke in some respects but there are also some benefits to breathing to one side, it all depends on the performer as to how often as well as how they breathe. But these are the most typical examples of breathing rate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last piece of advise:&lt;/strong&gt; find your own, natural pace! Best practices go a long way, but you also have to feel comfortable with them. Also, try to spend some time every week focusing on improving your technique, rather than your condition, because you'll need to make further improvements in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2013-05-12T14:49:27.543" LastActivityDate="2013-05-12T14:49:27.543" CommentCount="2" />

This belief is based on the idea that a &quot;tight&quot; muscle-tendon unit is less extensible without stretching, which means that its tolerance for elongation&#xA;  is lower, This intuitive concept has resulted in a widespread belief that stretching will prevent muscle and tendon strain (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mirallas.org/Esport/AgainstStretching.pdf&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Like many sports physicians, Dr. Bartoli tells her patients that rather than stretching before physical activity, they should do the sporting activity at 50 percent of the target intensity.

But based on the results from other literature reviews, I don't think the effect after a workout is much different. Also the lack of scientific interest in the topic should make one highly skeptical as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/medicine/bmj/sportsmedicine/pdfs/ch3.pdf&quot;&gt;Shrier points out several&lt;/a&gt; important points to consider:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Both the muscle-tendon unit and the joint capsule may limit ROM [range of motion]. Flexibility is usually considered the ROM limited by muscle-tendon, and mobility is usually considered the ROM limited by capsule/ligament.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Stretching must be differentiated from ROM. There are many individuals who have excellent ROM but never stretch, and many individuals who stretch but continue to have limited ROM.&#xA;  Therefore, different injury rates in people with different ROMs may not be related to the effect of stretching, but rather to the underlying interindividual variation in tissue properties, anatomy, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Stretching immediately before exercise may have different effects than stretching at other times and should be considered as a separate intervention. Whereas there is considerable amount of clinical&#xA;  data on stretching immediately before exercise, there is much less data on stretching at other times.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Some people claim that negative results in some studies are due to improper stretching technique. Because the effect of stretching are believed to occur through changes in stiffness and ROM,&#xA;  an &quot;improper&quot; technique implies that the ROM is not increased. If ROM is increased without causing an immediate injury, then by definition the stretches were done properly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Warm-up is not synonymous with stretching. In the colloquial sense, warm-up means any activity performed before participating in sport. Used in this sense, stretching is only one component of&#xA;  warm-up, and if stretching is included in the pre-exercise activity, I explicitily state that stretching was used. The other component of warm-up is participating in an activity that requires active muscle contractions.&#xA;  This type of warm-up can be divided into general or sport-specific warm-up. In a general warm-up, the objective is to increase body temperature. ... In sport-specific warmp-up, the acitvity is the same&#xA;  but performed at a lower intensity. Be aware that the mechanism of action will dictacte whether one type of warm-up is superior to another.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The term &quot;dynamic stretching&quot; is currently used differently by different people, but in essense it refers to stretching of a muscle by contracting and relaxing the antagonist muscle. &#xA;  One should note that dynamic stretching includes both classical stretching and warm-up at the same time. Because dynamic stretching includes both classical stretching and warm-up at the same time.&#xA;  Because dynamic stretching requires the muscles to contract, other possible mechansms include central programming of muscle contraction/coordiantion and decreased fatigue through increased warm-up activity.&#xA;  Those who promote dynamic stretching as a method to prevent injury should provide some evidence that supports their claim.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After discussing many articles he concludes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A review of the clinical evidence strongly suggests that pre-exercise stretching does not prevent injury, and that the evidence on stretching at other times suggests that it may be&#xA;  beneficial but is too limited to make definitive recommendations at this time. Considering that these results are contrary to many people’s beliefs, it seems prudent to review why&#xA;  some people ever believed stretching before exercise was so beneficial. There appear to be six general arguments that have been proposed in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;First, paraphrasing an old Chinese saying, “that which does not bend, breaks.” However, when a tree bends, the force (i.e., the wind) changes from a perpendicular force to a&#xA;  longitudinal force; it is much easier to break a stick by applying a perpendicular force to the middle in comparison with longitudinal forces at the end. In stretching a muscle prior&#xA;  to activity, we do not alter the direction of force at the time of injury, and the analogy is inappropriate.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Second, compliance refers to the length change that occurs when a force is applied, but is not necessarily related to a tissue’s resistance to injury. For example, even though a&#xA;  balloon will stretch before it bursts (high compliance), a sphere made of metal with the same thickness as the balloon might never stretch (low compliance) and still withstand&#xA;  extremely high pressures.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Third, if muscle compliance is increased with warming from 25 °C to 40 °C, the muscle ruptures at a longer length but absorbs less energy. Which is more important, length or&#xA;  energy absorbed? Although muscles are sometimes injured when stretched beyond their normal length of motion, most authors believe that the majority of injuries occur within&#xA;  the normal ROM during eccentric activity, and that the most important variable with respect to muscle injury is the energy absorbed by the muscle&#xA;  Finally, the reader must remember that the damage occurs at the level of the sarcomere and not the whole muscle. Therefore, if there is excessive sarcomere lengthening so that&#xA;  the actin and myosin filaments no longer overlap, the force is transmitted to the cytoskeleton of the muscle fiber, and damage occurs. This occurs within the normal ROM, because&#xA;  sarcomere length within the muscle is heterogeneous; some sarcomeres lengthen during a contraction at the same time as others are shortening. Therefore, it appears that it is&#xA;  the sarcomere length that is related to most exercise-related muscle strains, rather than the total muscle length. Under this hypothesis, an increase in total muscle compliance is&#xA;  irrelevant.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Fourth, overstretching a muscle can certainly produce damage. However, even strains as little as 20% beyond resting fiber length, as one would expect with “correct” stretching&#xA;  techniques, can produce damage in isolated muscle preparations. Therefore, the basic science evidence suggests that “correct” stretching techniques may be more difficult to&#xA;  define than previously thought.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Fifth, we have seen that the increased ROM with stretching is partly due to an analgesic effect. This may explain some preliminary findings that muscle aches and pains are&#xA;  reduced in pre–post testing, but does not mean that the risk of injury is decreased.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Sixth, some argue that stretching may prevent tendon or other injuries, even though there is no effect on total injuries. Finally, even if stretching does prevent one specific type of injury, because overall injury&#xA;  rates among stretchers and non-stretchers are not different, any protection against one type of injury would mean an increased risk of other types of injuries in order to balance the equation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on his results, on can conclude that there are some conflicting results. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.futevolei.com.br/fisio2.pdf&quot;&gt;Witvrouw et al&lt;/a&gt; point out that this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;can be explained by considering the type of sports activity in which an individual participates. Sports involving 'explosive' type skills, with many and maximal SSC (stretch-shortening cycles) movements require a muscle-tendon unit which is compliant enough to store and release the high amount of elastic energy. Recently, it has been shown that stretching is able to increase the compliance of human tendons, and as a result increase the capacity of the tendon to absorb energy. Consequently, in these sports we suggest that stretching is important as a prophylactic measure for injury prevention.&#xA;  When an individual's muscle-tendon unit is less flexible in these types of sports activities, there exists a predisposing factor for exercise-related injuries since the tendon is unable to absorb enough energy, which may lead to tendon and/or muscle damage. When the sports activity contains no, or only low SSC movements (cycling, jogging), all or most of the work is directly converted to external work.&#xA;  In these cases, there is no need for a compliant tendon since the amount of energy absorption remains low. Hence, additional stretching exercises to improve the compliance of the tendon may have no beneficial effect on injury prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It must be acknowledged that the aetiology of injuries can be multifactorial. Taking out only one aspect (e.g. stretching) and examining its effect on the incidence of injuries is a rather narrow outlook on this problem. For example, fatigue is  widely believed to be predisposing factor in muscle injury. In addition, other problems remain. Even within the same sport,the demands on different players may be different. However, we believe that far greater attention should be given to an examination of the type of activity in which the athlete participates when one considers the merits of stretching to reduce injury.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now I can see you wonder: &lt;strong&gt;what if my workout require a large ROM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To help you decide, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tca.d4sportsclub.com/object.aspx?id=516&amp;amp;o=486&quot;&gt;here's a small anecdote from a professional dance trainer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;She is often shocked when she walks into dance studios to teach for the first time and sees dancers stretching on a cold floor.&#xA;  &quot;I say, 'Please don't do that!' and explain that we'll stretch in the middle and at the end of class,&quot; she said.&#xA;  According to Solomon, stretching must be an integral part of the warm-up process.&#xA;  &quot;As long as the blood is coursing through the body, the oxygen is flowing through the muscles, and the muscles are warm-then you can stretch,&quot; she said. &quot;But not before. &#xA;  If you don't stretch and strengthen together, you'll have a weak muscle. The strength must balance the stretch if you want to control your movements.&quot;&#xA;  Solomon explained that dancers are at risk for injury partly because dance demands such extended ranges of motion. Moreover, ballet dancers typically do exercises such as &#xA;  developpes and grand battements that develop their quadriceps, but may neglect the hamstrings. The resulting strength imbalance puts extra stress on the knee joint.&#xA;  &quot;If the muscles are really stretched out, the ligaments may not be able to protect the joints,&quot; she said. &quot;So you get unstable joints, particularly knees, and you may get &#xA;  hyperextension and ligament tears.&quot; Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretches are now favored in the dance community because they both strengthen and lengthen muscles, Solomon said.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what should you do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well the studies I reviewed concluded injuries occured in subjects with too much flexibility (lack of balance/strength) or a lack of flexibility (limited ROM). The latter group might consider increasing their ROM by stretching regularly (but not prior to exercising), however I would rather recommend you to perform workouts that let you make the desired motion naturally. You see, your body adapts itself to its needs, so instead of stretching to become more flexible stop working out so rigidly! Even worse, if you would stop stretching, you would loose all the gained flexibility because the body&#xA;adapts itself to the lack of stretch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To understand this, one must understand the way your muscles are built up. Your muscle consist of actin and myosin, which glide into one another during a contraction. &#xA;These two parts optimize their length and overlap to get the highest force output. So if you start stretching your muscle, you require your muscle to adapt to retain an optimal overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/xBczD.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I expect you want to stretch after a workout because your muscles are still feeling contracted and by 'stretching' them, they'll be more relaxed. You know, yoga-style!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/PoZlE.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if I show you this image and tell you that the mysion 'arms' require ATP (energy!) to release the actin, else they'd be holding on like rigor mortis. &#xA;Furthermore, we just saw that your muscles probably have a lot of overlap and crossbridges, but you just depleted your energy resources, because you had an intensive workout.&#xA;Do you think you're muscle will respond well to stretching?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, &lt;strong&gt;I'd recommend you do a proper cooling-down&lt;/strong&gt;, give your muscles time to get rid of lactate (which is a great resource of energy, when you burn it aerobically) and more importantly give it time to relax.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.futevolei.com.br/fisio2.pdf&quot;&gt;Stretching and injury prevention, An obscure relationship&lt;/a&gt;.

After the local storage is gone, your blood will have to resupply your muscles to deliver you new energy. This also means, that if you start working on another muscle group, that muscle group has to share its new supplies of energy with the muscles that are recovering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if you were to rest, your body has a storage of lactate acid it needs to process and an oxygen deficit to compensate for. This requires oxygen, but more importantly produces a lot of CO2 your body needs to get rid off. This is called having an oxygen debt. If you switch muscle groups, you don't give your body time to recover from its oxygen deficit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/cIkCh.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're trying to work out on your maximum lung capacity, you have to subtract a part of your oxygen supply for the oxygen debt, so you're not working out maximally anymore: you're simply out of breath. Furthermore, if you can't supply your muscles with sufficient oxygen, it will anaerobically burn it's fuels. While they're a great fuel, it won't last you very long and it will most likely hamper the amount of repetitions you can make with the same fuel. Because as soon as you rest, then the fuel get's processed again, but you already moved on to another muscle group...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your body feels tired, your central nervous system (CNS) might also inhibit any further exercise. It won't stop you from trying, but you probably won't be able to perform the amount of reps you could perform with sufficient rest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So all in all, even if you were to switch muscle groups: &lt;strong&gt;your body needs some rest between repetitions&lt;/strong&gt;.

If you were to stop abruptly, you leave your muscles in a somewhat misaligned state. By cooling down, you gradually limit the range of motion back to the state it would be in when you're in rest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So basically, &lt;strong&gt;the goal of cooling down is giving your body time to readjust itself to the change in requirements.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ajp.physiotherapy.asn.au/AJP/vol_53/2/AustJPhysiotherv53i2Law.pdf&quot;&gt;a study by Law and Herbert from the university of Sydney&lt;/a&gt; indicated that cooling down &lt;strong&gt;did not reduce delayed-onset muscle soreness&lt;/strong&gt;.

Ideally this place would be your toes; however, due to the toe joints, your ability to do so is rather limited, as the the flexible joint will change the way power is transmitted through your foot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the optimal place to step is the ball of the foot -- it has a good surface area for good contact, and the muscular mass which reduces the reaction from the pedal and dampens somewhat vibrations from the bumpy road. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to why the most efficient place is as far from your heel as possible:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See this handy force diagram below that I found when writing my answer (image license unknown).

They are related linearly as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Tc=PF.CL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Simple enough?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt; You might be tempted to think that if you make your pedals long enough, you can exert enormous amount of force, and indeed this is so. Archimedes famously said &quot;Give me a place to stand, and I shall move the earth with a lever&quot;. The thing is, your feet will need to travel much farther to cover the same distance as with shorter pedals -- but requiring a  negligible force. There ain't no such thing as a free lunch in mechanics as well. &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But wait, this only takes into account the length of the pedal, not the foot!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Indeed. Your foot only serves as an extension of the pedal, effectively increasing the torque you produce by increasing the lever length. If the length of your foot is &lt;code&gt;Lf&lt;/code&gt;, then the torque will become:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Tc=PF(CL + Lf)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;effectively increasing the torque you produce.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="180" LastEditorUserId="180" LastEditDate="2011-03-07T19:50:11.923" LastActivityDate="2011-03-07T19:50:11.923" CommentCount="6" />

One study raises the possibility that this might offer injury protection...For the intervention program, the athletes stretched after practicing and while fatigued...&lt;strong&gt;Results favored the intervention in that in preintervention 9 and 11 athletes sustained hamstring injury compared with 2 and 4 after intervention.&lt;/strong&gt; In addition, competition days missed were reduced from 31 and 38 to 5 and 16 after intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also stretching does seem to be of use in relief of an injury (again Fields):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The most positive of these involved a stretching intervention in plantar fasciitis...For phase 2, all patients were given the PF stretch protocol. &lt;strong&gt;Follow-up at 2 yr showed that 92% had a high degree of satisfaction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, streching does seem to be helpful in the removal of 'tightness' and enabling freer motion of the muscles.

However, there does seems to be conclusive evidence from multiple studies to suggest that relief of muscle soreness, and gain in freedom of motion can be improved through use of stretching.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention of Running Injuries&lt;/strong&gt;.

You can do it as often as you feel energetic and not sore, but a good starting goal might be 2x/week; err on the side of an extra day of rest rather than straining yourself because muscles grow when they recover. I would suggest doing 3-5 sets of 8 reps of each with a couple minutes rest between each set. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as how much weight to use, you need to first use a very light weight and make sure that you have your form down (pay attention to the tips and the motions in the videos). When you're comfortable with the movements, add weight for each exercise gradually. If you're doing 8 reps per set, then you'll want a weight at which you'd fail after perhaps 10-12 reps. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few other hints that will help pay off down the road:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Keep your core tight when doing these exercises&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Squeeze the bar when you're lifting, especially for the dumbell curls.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lower the weight slowly; these are called &lt;em&gt;negatives&lt;/em&gt; and can be as beneficial as lifting the weight up&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="22" LastActivityDate="2011-03-08T03:47:42.993" CommentCount="1" />

I say this not to brag but so you know the position I'm saying this from, one not just of my personal experience but also the experience of working with others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, plateaus happen. They just do. The body is extremely complex and not predictable and sometimes you may go several weeks without losing weight. Sometimes you may even gain it. It's not always fat, but in fact can be water weight and other factors that are sometimes related to the stress of dropping the weight. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what you are using to gauge progress but weighing daily is fine to see the trend over time but making decisions should only happen weekly or bi-weekly as that's enough time to see a real change. So, I wouldn't call a plateau a &quot;real plateau&quot; unless it's lasted at least 2 - 3 weeks. This is where many people get frustrated and give up, so the key here is &quot;don't give in.&quot; Keep pushing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you get past that point, obviously something has to change. You really have two main opportunities to do this: training and nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With nutrition, sometimes it may seem counter-intuitive but you may want to increase calories slightly to give your body a break from extreme dieting. While I know Weight Watchers is based on points I'm not a fan because I don't think it promotes the right types and combinations of foods. If anything, one smart move will be to add as many fresh or lightly steamed vegetables as possible. I know so many people who don't believe how powerful it is to add tons of vegetables and are amazed when they do it and break through a plateau. When I dropped my weight, I would literally bring a whole bag of frozen broccoli or green beans into the office and cook it and eat it throughout the day. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other is fiber. It's easy to eat &quot;x&quot; calories with processed foods, bars, pre-made meals, but one thing you'll find is a lot of those lack fiber. To the extent you can switch to as natural as possible with your foods - pick whole oats over processed cereal, pick old fashioned oatmeal over instant, pick fresh fruit over fruit juice, etc - you'll also increase your fiber intake. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, this one is very specific to women. Unfortunately, history created a huge misperception of fats as evil and people have shied away. People are finally starting to learn fats are not created equal and that there are healthy fats. They are still shy of these fats however and too many people work on reduced fat as opposed to switching to quality fat. Women require a steady intake of healthy fats and oils as their estrogen production is tied to it. I can't tell you how many women I coached would come to me AMAZED after just a few weeks of adding fats because despite the extra calories, they suddenly started dropping weight, lost cravings, even saw reduced PMS symptoms and more regular menstrual cycles. If your wife is not eating foods with healthy fats - salmon, other cold water fish, even getting 2% as opposed to 0 fat dairy - I'd suggest she try that out and even consider supplementation with fish oil or flax oil. That can be a major plateau buster for someone not getting a quality intake of healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For training, changing the style of training is key. Most people do slow, steady state (long jogs, bikes, etc) and switching to interval-style training can be a booster (you can Bing &quot;HIIT&quot; and find out more). Hopefully her trainer isn't sticking to the same resistance routine but is keeping that fresh as well. If she's not into cardio, perhaps a cardio tape or something that has her moving in a different way will help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key is change - change the nutrition, eat healthy options but don't eat the exact same meal every day, and change the training. If she needs to add a little more and her schedule permits, do it! Keep pushing through and you can and will bust that plateau. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Best of health and success to you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jeremy&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="208" LastActivityDate="2011-03-08T22:36:33.497" CommentCount="1" />

Even elite athletes who take on volumes of training most of us would not be able to comprehend have smart periods of lighter training and even full rest periods. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Physiologically training works by stressing the body just enough that the adaptation allows you to recover and the body overshoots a bit so you end up stronger/more coordinated than before. Doing this too much, however, will back fire due to a principle known as GAS (General Adaptation Syndrome). You can read about it here: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.healthnewsnet.com/gap.html&quot;&gt;http://www.healthnewsnet.com/gap.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically it ultimately leads to exhaustion and dramatically increases risk of injury. In training steadily (3 - 5 days per week) for the past 10 years I've had no serious injuries because I build in rest. On the flipside I know people who refuse to stop, believing &quot;more is better&quot; and go non stop ... until an injury has them on their back for months. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much better to build in the rest periods when you can control them than to end up being forced to rest because you didn't allow your body the recovery it needs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You'll often hear you are less likely to need rest if you alternate muscle groups. After all, if I work my legs, my arms are resting, right? This isn't entirely true for two reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reason one: unless you're using totally isolated movements like single arm dumbbells, machines, etc, your other muscles do participate to an extent. Your core is always stabilizing your torso, your leg muscles work to provide stability while your upper body is moving, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reason two, and more important: every workout taxes your neuromuscular system. There is a neurological effect. This is where the idea of &quot;muscle memory&quot; comes from and the reason why some people can be extremely strong without having large muscles - it's because their neurological system reacts to the workout by improving coordination of motor units, the bundles of nerves that fire to contract muscle (when you lift a heavy weight or a small one, motor units are helping you do that and it's just a question of how many are activated at once). Any type of training will tax your central nervous system and too much training can lead to fatigue. This fatigue can tax your adrenal system and raise cortisol levels, a stress hormone that also makes it more difficult to burn fat. Literally you'll stress your body to the point your metabolism slows, you burn fat less efficiently and stop making strength gains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So yes, please build in rest. If you train 5 - 6 days per week then a week of light activity is probably fine, but even elite athletes I know try to take at least a week off of ALL training at least once per year. I've found if I train just 3 - 4 days per week then I can go a lot longer without having to take a longer period for rest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="208" LastActivityDate="2011-03-08T23:03:23.230" CommentCount="2" />

If you will be spending the majority of your time consumed in your programming addiction and taking care of your new child, the best exercise for you is walking.  Walking will drastically reduce the chance of you getting an injury, which could stop you from doing any form of exercise.  Also, more intense forms of cardio or weights require a good amount of sleep to be effective.  Walking is also something you can do with your baby.  If you currently aren't doing any form of exercising now, start with a 20 minute walk the first week.  Over a month or two try to increase the walk to an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Flexibility: If you decide to do more intense cardio (or even if you don't), I suggest you work on flexibility.  There are some great books on stretching, and there is also yoga :)  Flexibility will help prevent injury (especially as your baby turns into a toddler).  Yoga also consists of breathing exercises, which have been reported by many as beneficial to their overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sleep: I suggest you do your best to keep it consistent.  This means going to bed at the same time and always sleeping a minimum number of hours.  Eight hours is recommended, but some research has shown the older you are, the less sleep you need.  I would avoid the 20 minute naps in your condition, as the REM sleep you would get from a solid 5+ hours of sleep would be very beneficial. I have not had a child yet, but I believe it will be difficult, so good luck!  If you are sensitive to caffeine, do your best to avoid it a few hours before sleeping.  Also, pay attention to the last meals or foods you eat before sleeping.  Some may help you sleep better, and others may ruin a potential good night sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Diet: Use the general BMI scale and your a low exercise level to determine how many calories you should eat in a day.  I would suggest a low fat (less than 20%), and a low protein (less than 25%) diet.  Stick with a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and if you are not a vegetarian, fish, lean meats, and low fat dairy products.  If you are not getting 4-5 different colors of foods every day from vegies/fruit, and/or if you are not eating any meats, I would suggest looking into supplements (but that's a whole different long conversation).  If you have a hard time keeping within the recommended calories, try to slowly increase more fiber into your diet.  Both fiber and protein have shown effects of curbing hunger.  Do you best to avoid bleach/enriched flour, processed sugar, and salt.  Drink plenty of water (8+ cups a day).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Congratulations on the baby, and good luck!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="224" LastEditorUserId="224" LastEditDate="2011-03-09T14:25:29.213" LastActivityDate="2011-03-09T14:25:29.213" CommentCount="0" />

I am not a doctor and you should talk to your doctor before doing exercise with an injury.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of this is going to depend on the exact location and nature of the injury. The problem with injuries in the groin (especially upper groin) and abdominal area is that it's your core muscles. That means that almost any strenuous exercise is going to have the possibility of hurting or re-injuring because people tend to tighten that area when they strain other muscles. Even if you could immobilize the area, you might still tense the muscles. Given that, I would stay away from any heavy lifting, even upper body.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Si Philip's suggestion of using a hand cycle is excellent since it could be low stress and if you're seated properly shouldn't put any stress on the groin area.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I might also try a modified crunch that's even shorter than a regular crunch. When you do a sit-up from your back, the initial part of the motion uses your psoas muscles (which connect in at the groin area) rather extensively. As your body rises up you start to engage the abdominal muscles more and the psoas muscles less. If you started up near the top and just did short motions you might be able to almost completely eliminate the psoas muscles from the picture. I haven't tried this and again, I'm not a doctor, so you need to be extremely careful if you want to go this route. If you feel any groin pain AT ALL, stop immediately. If you have access to an ab machine (the kind that you can sit up in) and you can rig it to allow for the shorter motion at the end of the spectrum then that might work even better as you can get into position more easily without using the groin (with a crunch you still need to sit up for the first one). Just use very little or no weight to start.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The MOST IMPORTANT piece of advice though is this: being out of commission for some amount of time may stink, but it's much worse if you end up re-injuring the muscle and causing an even longer time injured. If you need to completely take time away from working out then do that and spend the time concentrating on other areas - improved diet, better sleep habits, mental health, etc. If you push things too soon it ends up being counterproductive because instead of the small improvement in health from one or two extra workouts you could end up causing a long, extended time injured, so it's just not worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="300" LastEditorUserId="300" LastEditDate="2011-03-21T15:05:00.583" LastActivityDate="2011-03-21T15:05:00.583" CommentCount="0" />

Since your body needs more energy than is provided by 1200 calories, the carbohydrates are burned first, and as your blood sugar decreases, your body stops producing insulin, and then the excess required energy is taken from the body's fat supply.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trust me, I actually tried this 1200 calories of carbs a day one time to see it's effect, and I lost quite a bit of weight.

I was eating four meals a day and was still pretty hungry in between when I was doing this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Weight loss this way is very slow and ineffective, difficult to maintain, and very bad for your body.

Now that my running form has greatly improved from the sorry lot that I was going into that program my freshman year, I was able to run in most anything. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Originally, I would have said that I could only run in stability shoes in college, because of my pronation issues, but during high school I did ballet 5 times a week and had really strong arches and actually ran in training shoes and minimalist wear a lot (although I only ran about 20 miles a week compared to collegiate 35-55 miles a week). Now that I've strengthened my arches by a lot of barefoot strides, barefoot cooldowns, running in my Invisible shoes for my double day easy runs, and walking around my house in Invisible Shoes, now I can run in the Nike structure triax, a brooks adrenalin, an Invisible Shoe &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.invisibleshoe.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.invisibleshoe.com/&lt;/a&gt;, a Saucony Kinvara, a Nike Free for 14 miles without any issues...   barefoot barefoot if I'm on a soccer field I could run forever or on dirt...

You don't need minimalist footwear to improve running form, but it can help. And once you have great running form and strong arches, strong hip flexors, etc etc, you can run in practically anything or nothing and it shouldn't make a difference. So there's no downside to minimalism, simply a downside to impatient Americans who don't want to put in the time to improve their overall strength and running form and want a quick fix versus to see the overall problem-- that their arches and foot ligaments/tendons have atrophied and weakened over years of wearing overly cushioned running shoes that act as a cast.

When the sports activity contains no, or only low SSC movements (cycling, jogging), all or most of the work is directly converted to external work. &lt;strong&gt;In these cases, there is no need for a compliant tendon since the amount of energy absorption remains low.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cycling doesn't rely on stretch-shortening cycles for producing power and but rather requires a steady supply of power. Having a more compliant muscle-tendon complex would just mean your muscle has to shorten more to take up all the 'slack' in the muscle before supplying the same amount of power. In general, your body adapts itself to the workouts you do, so if you get 'short' muscles that's because you use them that way. If you want to change the length, change your bike settings instead and you'll start using them differently as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So your right, &lt;strong&gt;it's most likely better to do a good warming up than to stretch.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.futevolei.com.br/fisio2.pdf&quot;&gt;Stretching and injury prevention, An obscure relationship&lt;/a&gt;.

I suggest those who don't know what motor units are &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_unit_recruitment&quot;&gt;start reading up a little bit&lt;/a&gt; :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/W1flF.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taking the biceps as an example, this muscle has about 200 of these motor units to stimulate all the muscle fibers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But you want to contract your muscle, they don't all go fire at the same time. This is due to the &lt;strong&gt;size principle&lt;/strong&gt;, motor units of the smallest size will be recruited first. For a more detailed explanation, I can recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0071216847&quot;&gt;Human Physiology: The Mechanism of Body Function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/RXTUj.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As this picture shows, your muscle fibers are divided into roughly three groups. First the green ones are recruited: these are your Type I fibers, meant for endurance. Then when you start to recruit more motor units (by increasing the force of the contraction), you recruit the yellow ones: these are your faster Type II fibers, but as you can see they aren't the strongest muscle fibers. If you would contract even harder, you would start recruiting all your motor units (well as much as possible) and you reach your maximal power output.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this have to do with shooting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you lift a lot of heavy weights, you're mostly training that last group of muscle fibers. When you do this enough, you're muscles start to adapt to become better at it. However, &lt;strong&gt;my hypothesis&lt;/strong&gt; would be that this influences how your muscles recruit muscle fibers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now if keeping a gun stretched out requires 20% of your biceps forces, that means it has to recruit the yellow muscle fibers. But since they work in an on/off kind of way, they'll recruit a surplus of fibers and thus produce more force than required, so you have to counter it with your triceps. But that muscle is also a lot stronger, so your muscles have a very hard time at load balancing to keep your arm steady!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, weight lifters aren't trained for fine-grained motion, so regardless of whether my hypothesis is entirely correct, you're training your muscles for the wrong kind of exercise. &lt;strong&gt;So yes, I'd say they are &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; conflicting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8" LastActivityDate="2011-03-09T23:12:20.710" CommentCount="1" />

For example, do 15 minutes each of three of the above.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a twist on combining those cardio machines together, when you switch, spend 5 minutes doing very light plyometrics - even jumping jacks would suffice there.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On some of those machines you can even vary the style of motion you make. Some suggestions there:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the treadmill, increase the incline, ortry a slower pace while side shuffling or walking backwards.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the elliptical, vary the angle and try going backwards&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On a stairmaster, turn around and do it backwards&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tweak the custom programs on each machine to do things like Hill Training or Interval training... or Random.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, the principle I'd suggest is to constantly switch it up.

Unless you take illegal and questionable supplements your body is not going to have time to recover and the result is that you're actually breaking down muscle tissue instead of building it up. You also don't want to exercise for more than 30-45 minutes at a time because it increases cortisol hormone which is catabolic. If you want to increase muscle you want a high level of anabolic hormones (like testosterone) and a low level of catabolic hormones (like cortisol or adrenaline).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember that it's not the weight lifting itself that builds muscle tissue. It's the hormonal changes induced by the weight lifting, the resting time in between lifting and the food that you eat that builds muscle. Given that weight lifting is actually catabolic in nature and breaks down muscle tissue you want to find the perfect sweet spot of lifting just enough to induce a hormonal change while minimizing how much muscle is broken down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This should form the scientific basis on selecting a training program.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are widely different opinions on exactly where this sweet spot is and depending on genetics and whether supplements are used this sweet spot will be different for you compared to others. The best way to find your sweet spot is to track progress by using an exercise log and a measuring tape (MyoTape is good as you can use it with one hand). You want to increase weight or time under load (this is a more accurate measurement than number of repetitions) almost continuously. If you stop progressing for several weeks you're either not getting enough rest (add more rest), not enough food (eat more) or your body has adapted to your current routine (find a new routine).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are also other factors that can change your hormonal balance such as too much alcohol or smoking (can decrease testosterone) or too much stress or too little sleep (increases cortisol).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've studied various weight lifting workout strategies lately and the approach that seems to be based on the most recent research is the high intensity training (also called &quot;HIT&quot;) approach outlined in for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0071597174&quot;&gt;Body by Science&lt;/a&gt;.

That would seem to imply that one would then be able to lose some of their fat weight, as they would now have a more favorable ratio of caloric intake to caloric expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is this a healthful approach to weight loss?

Certainly, it absorbs locally, but it doesn't make your leg fall off. Such items as the red pepper and the menthol will be more noticeable at the localized area because of their extreme effects on the nerve endings and their diminished effects as they are spread thinner through the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My advice would be to test this in theory if you really want to see if it works. Simple method: take yesterday's coffee that was left on the burner overnight, mix it into some menthol rub, add some finely ground red peppers (they will extract into the caffeine/menthol suspension), and you'll have to buy some houttuynia cordata extract. Then rub this concoction on your skin. It will sting and tingle a little bit for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final question is: Will it stimulate caloric burn? In order to achieve weight loss, one must burn more calories than they consume. The body's ability to absorb this mixture will require metabolization within the internal organs of the substance absorbed through the skin. This is also true if the substance were ingested. I would say that given the amount of the mixture one might use, it is unlikely that it would stimulate the metabolism enough to make any detectable change on any sensitivity of equipment used for such testing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even from the review you linked in comments on your question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But then again like many other toning gel, this cannot give you your desired results if you won’t cut your calorie intake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary, you could acquire the same materials that these gels are primarily comprised of for a fraction of the cost of the gels, and the bottom line is that they will have negligible effects on any stimulation of weight or fat loss.

The 15 minutes before also seems to fit, as roughly half of liquid consumed 15 minutes beforehand will have been emptied before the meal starts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If one further considers the dynamics, drinking water immediately before a meal will help fill up the stomach and reduce immediate hunger but will cause that meal to be digested faster, so I hypothesize that you will be hungrier sooner with this approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="22" LastEditorUserId="22" LastEditDate="2011-03-12T05:47:16.550" LastActivityDate="2011-03-12T05:47:16.550" CommentCount="11" />

One may step into the tub to relieve sore calves, quads, hams, and connective tissues from hips to toes will gain the same benefits, making hydrotherapy an attractive preventive regimen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The second advantage involves a physiological reaction provoked by the large amount of muscle submerged. Assuming one has overcome the mind's initial flight response in those first torturous minutes, the body fights back by invoking a &quot;blood rush&quot;. This rapid transmission circulation flushes the damage-inflicting waste from the system, while the cold water on the outside preserves contraction. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/sampleworkouts/a/Ice-Bath.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Reference: [14] is a decent About.com review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cebp.nl/vault_public/filesystem/?ID=3149&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a study by Sellwood et al&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Ice-water immersion and delayed-onset muscle soreness: a randomised controlled trial&quot; found no significant changes in pain parameters, tenderness, isometric strength, swelling, hop-for-distance or serum creatine kinase (CK) over time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18058595&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Vaile et al found in their study&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Effect of hydrotherapy on recovery from fatigue&quot; that: &lt;code&gt;Sprint (0.1 - 2.2 %) and a total of 9-min sustained effort (time trial - TT) (0.0 - 1.7 %) performance were enhanced across the five-day trial following cold water immersion (CWI) and contrast water therapy (CWT), when compared to hot water immersion (HWI) and passive recovery (PAS).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would therefore hypothesize that the effect of a cold water bath may depend on the type of workout and the intensity thereof.
