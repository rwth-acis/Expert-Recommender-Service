<p>All of my personal systems run Linux (typically Ubuntu) as it tends to suit my tinkering nature more so than other operating systems.  I try hard not to be dogmatic about such things, however.</p>

<p>I enjoy using my experience to help others. That is why I am active at a number of <a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/10806/torben-gundtofte-bruun?tab=accounts\">other sites</a> in the StackExchange network on topics that interest me. </p>

<p><a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/235c7dd1f1bb4049ac1e0f6c70b8d1cd\"><img src=\"http://se-flair.appspot.com/png/235c7dd1f1bb4049ac1e0f6c70b8d1cd\" alt=\"valuable flair!\"></a> </p>

<p>I'm something of a Swiss army knife both professionally and in private, able to juggle a wild variety of things at once. I've worked in every kind of business that uses software. I'm also very good with tools, both IT and mechanic. Whether you need software design or assembling some IKEA furniture, I'm your man for the job. I'm generally soft-spoken but driven by clear principles.</p>

<p>I'm a twin, I've lived in five countries, I speak four languages fluently and two more embarrassingly. Also, being a father routinely develops my patience which is useful for moderating on StackExchange too. </p>

<p>I am an IT \"<a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/anonjr\">Jack of all Trades</a>\" with experience in graphics design, web programming, and server administration. I've even done some photography and acquired a wide assortment of other skills.</p>

<p>Because of the variety of jobs I've performed, I've grown into a robust and 
innovative problems solver.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the majority of my projects and writing are tied up behind Cape Fear Valley's firewall.</p>

<p>One of my side projects has been working with a local Christian Rock group - <a href=\"http://jesusjoshua2415.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jesus Joshua 24:15</a>. I've been their photographer and webmaster, having built their website as a class project and growing it to their current site. Additionally, I've been their roadie, studio technician, and helped upgrade their recording studio.</p>

<p>For over a year, my .NET skills were blunted by the necessity of working almost exclusively in <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/coldfusion\">ColdFusion</a>. Still, it gave me chance to get to know MVC a lot more through <a href=\"http://www.mach-ii.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mach-II</a>. When ASP.NET MVC came out, I felt I had a good advantage, and had would have a stronger knowledge than if I had continued using 'classic' ASP.NET webforms.</p>

<p>I enjoy the fact that stackoverflow is more community based than Experts Exchange, which really makes users feel isolated.</p>

<p>Also, I've answered more questions in the two months here, than I did in five years at <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=experts+exchange+scam\" rel=\"nofollow\">Experts Exchange</a>.</p>

<p>Initially spurred on by the challenge of \"doing better than <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/261677/jonathon-bolster\">Jonathon Bolster</a>\", I found that helping out is extremely enjoyable and helping people of all technical skill levels is great fun.</p>

<p>I've worked on a variety of types of projects ranging from short term individual work to very large scale, multi-phase projects using multiple large development teams.</p>

<p>I've developed both back end message processing systems as well as end user facing webapps.</p>

<p>I most enjoy working on smaller teams with other talented developers in an environment where we are responsible for the entire application stack end to end.</p>

<p>I'm lucky enough to have a great job that I enjoy leading a product development team at a small company in Dallas, but I'm always interested in hearing about other opportunities.

I have three years of experience at a small start-up company which I would not suggest to everyone, but for those willing to teach themselves, it is an excellent opportunity.
<br/>
<br/>
I currently work in medical proton therapy as a systems engineer. Both the details of a functioning particle accelerator and the beam physics I work with keep me interested in the day to day of my job.

I am also currently pursuing a masters degree in electrical engineering.

<p>I use Apple hardware and Mac OS X since the age of dawn but work doing Android development using <s>Eclipse</s> Intellij-IDEA. Used to be a .NET/C# guy.<br /></p>

<p>I do some Objective-C when time permits (never lately) and always experiment in Xcode when it's not crashing.</p>

<p>I have lived in the netherlands until 2003 when I moved to the south of France in a little village called Felines Minervois filled with old and rusty wine makers. It was a charming place and I've really enjoyed living there. In 2005 I moved again to Vias, a bigger coastal village closer to what I call \"civilisation\".</p>

<p>As for work, Having both worked in sales and marketing I have an affinity for launching and promoting products. This is mixed with my love for entrepreneurship that has already lead me to the production and launch of the popular online product called iWebKit, available at <a href=\"http://snippetspace.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://snippetspace.com</a> .</p>

<p>My past experienced combined with my business school study give me a head start for my future life. Speaking English, french and dutch my goal would be to work internationally and set up my own software or web service company later in life. This comes mainly for my love of Technology of all kind and the potential I see in that branch of business.</p>

I work currently with Java, MySQL and XML, and worked before with a lot of RDBMS like Oracle, Sybase, Teradata.</p>

<p>I also have knowledge in C, C++, Javascript, shellscript, social network application programming (Facebook, Opensocial, Twitter), image processing, Android, payment solutions implementation (Paypal) and more.</p>

<p>About personal projects: I started the <a href=\"http://fr.wikibooks.org/wiki/Accueil/Informatique\" rel=\"nofollow\">french wikibook on programming</a> (yeah, back in 2004 or something). I was very involved at different levels in Wikipedia and sister projects for 5 years, until 2008. Consumed most of my spare time, then. But it was worth it.</p>

<p>Since 2008, I have some fun with <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenStreeMap</a>. Great project!</p>

<p>I also wrote a XML generation library in Java, based on a stack used for depth-priority tree processing. I stopped the development when it became obvious I was actually remaking the generation part of StAX... Currently, I'm working on a multithreading library in Java, based on a graph model, each node being a thread. It's called <a href=\"https://github.com/Traroth/Archipel\" rel=\"nofollow\">Archipel</a>.</p>

<p>I hope to get some time (if my current move from one corner of Paris to another finally takes an end...) to write an image manipulation library in Java.</p>

<p>I'm also a real free software maniac. Free as in free speech...</p>

<p>My other center of interest are photography (I got a Canon 7D I'm having real fun with. I took the picture of a polar fox I'm using as an avatar with my older 350D), cooking (I'm french, after all :-) and seeing museums, especially art (I can't grow tired of the Marmottan Museum and its unique Monet paintings collection).</p>

<p>My 2 mother tongues are french and german, and apparently I'm not all so bad in english... :-). Beside France, I worked in Germany and Switzerland (where I also lived).</p>

In late 2010 I began working and was thrown into SharePoint 2010 including the entire 2010 Microsoft Office Suite including InfoPath and Visio. I loved it because it was something new I can learn and huge so I will always be learning something new with SharePoint. I had taught myself for 6 months, went to meetings, attended webinars and forums, then I was laid off for over a year minus 3 months (busy season help). </p>

<p>December 2012 I began a position as a SharePoint Site Collection Administrator and am very excited and I am still up to the challenges SharePoint throws my way and I am eager to learn and figure out how to get a task completed that appears to be challenging. Also, I am thankful for the help that I receive from all of you to help me become more proficent at taming this beast (that is a good thing)!</p>

<p>September 2013 I began a position as a Systems Specialist, Sr. Analyst with the role of SharePoint Specialist where I am working with SP &amp; SPD 2007 and WSS3, modifying code and working in XSL.</p>

<p>My programming ventures began way back during the days of BBS's, and eventually evolved into website development. For the most part I use PHP, the old-school way, but I am trying to grasp JQuery, OOP, MVC and the Yii Framework more recently.</p>

<p>I would like to think my programming is just a hobby, but if you measure a hobby by the time spent doing it, then this must be more than a hobby! I enjoy the challenges of programming. and it keeps my mind occupied. I am always eager to learn and will answer a few questions too, but I am definitely more of a student than a teacher!</p>

I also have several years of experience managing accounts, developers, and projects, and have worked with teams both on and off shore.</p>

<p>While the early stages of my career were on PHP with focus on server-side applications and database architecture in a LAMP environment, I've since been primarily focusing on building rich JavaScript applications with Node, Mongo, Redis and Socket.io on an Nginx stack in combination with front-end tools such as Angular, Bower, Jasmine, LESS, RequireJS and others. I regularly take advantage of tools such as Grunt and Vagrant to optimize my workflow and ease collaboration burdens. I'm also a certified Titanium developer for Appcelerator with experience building mobile apps on iOS and Android and enjoy dabbling in game code via ActionScript3 in Flash and ObjectiveC in Unity in my spare time.</p>

Whilst nothing more than using the working examples provided by the 300 page A4-sized manual that comes with the PC, it was enough to have me hooked from that early age.</p>

<p>Roll forward to 1996, and I begin learning to program with Visual Basic 3 (VB3) in combination with SQL Databases, for simple user input.  A quick jump to VB4 and then VB5, and after a year I'm working for a company on Sales Ordering project.</p>

<p>About ten years later, with a migration to VB6 and then VB.Net, adoption of Windows CE programing (from WinCE 3.0 up), I move to Manchester UK and begin programming in C#.  Two years later I'm familiar with Windows Forms, Mobile development, Database development, Reporting, and I'm getting into Business Intelligence (BI).</p>

<p>These days I work Windows Phone 7 as a hobby, and try to convince others that BI is not black magic, and not <strong>just</strong> reporting.</p>

<p>\"Focus is a matter of deciding what things you're not going to do.\"</p>

<p>\"Focused, hard work is the real key to success. Keep your eyes on the goal, and just keep taking the next step towards completing it. If you aren't sure which way to do something, do it both ways and see which works better.\"</p>

<p>\"In the information age, the barriers just aren't there. The barriers are self imposed. If you want to set off and go develop some grand new thing, you don't need millions of dollars of capitalization. You need enough pizza and Diet Coke to stick in your refrigerator, a cheap PC to work on, and the dedication to go through with it.\"</p>

<p>I've been writing code since I was 12 years old (professionally since 22 or so), and some day – hopefully soon - I'll figure out how to do it properly.<br/></p>

<p>I'm married (sorry ladies), and she's gorgeous, she's so far out of my league we're playing different sports. I swear there are days I marvel that she doesn't snap out of it and decide she can do far better :) . . . but I’m very glad she doesn’t. <br/></p>

<p>My second love for many years would have been C++, which has been pushed out by C#, very powerful, very concise. <br/></p>

<p>I often work with Vb, but I dislike it, being much more enamoured of the curly brace than I am of hugely verbose syntax.<br/></p>

<p>Although it’s many years since we last parted, I still hold a grudge against Vb3, 4, 5 &amp; 6, oh, and all flavours of VBA. Languages that are, IMHO, as wrong and unholy as . . . well . . .  something that’s <em>really</em> wrong and unholy (pick your own desecration and go with that imagery, I’m not going to do all the work for you). . . there are whole years I spent bleeding and blistered on the Pre Vb.Net cross . . . and I’m glad I can say “never again”.<br/></p>

M$ had this great idea to just integrate all of its software so that they would all work together seamlessly. This would be great for users of this software since this would make doing things like importing a webpage in a Ward processing (because in magicland we have wards instead of words) document, seemlessly and natively.</p>

<p>But this would evidently make the software too good. And we cant have people getting software that is too good. Because then if another company came along with their own version of good software people will be too dumb to install and use that if they have the already integrated versions that were included. So the Neanderthal Union decreed that M$ was using its magical abilities to make things too difficult for smaller developers to create super complex applications that they must give away for free. And said you will no longer make things work together seemlessly.</p>

<p>And instead of extending their middle wand to the NeU and saying fine we shall no longer make software that can be used in the NeU... M$ bowed before the luddites and said ok. So now you can not rename a file from inside of your office productivity suite in Magicland.</p>

<p>Feel free to stalk my Internet name(s) if you wish - it's how I make most of my closest contacts these days. Just note that I don't really believe in social constructs when they get in the way of satisficing (or in the way of my goal of learning as much as possible). </p>

<p>Don't take anything I say/do too seriously.  A lot of the things I do (that may look weird/stupid on the outside) are the types of things that help me adjust my posterior probability of various things - especially low probability events.Sometimes I hit on a jackpot/very interesting idea. I'm kind of messy since it helps facilitate creative destruction.</p>

<p>I have <em>a lot</em> of respect for <em>all</em> of the sciences. Tactically, I'm developing heuristics for rationality, impartiality, anti-laziness, and creation+identification+searching for what's relevant+reliable. Strategically, I just want to learn everything.</p>

<p>A lot of my thought processes involve my creating new hypotheses and refuting them on my own. I still document the thought process since it's important and may be important for future \"true\" hypotheses.</p>

"2179","24283","ahsteele","136","2011-10-18T17:48:45.750","United States","<p>My academic and professional backgrounds have always influenced each other. I began my professional career at sixteen as a technical support consultant for America Online (AOL). My success in this role led to two excellent project management internships with AOL, one in Arizona and one at AOL Corporate Headquarters in Virginia. I enjoyed these internships so much that I began my collegiate journey convinced that I wanted to be a project manager working on software development projects. As the dot-com bubble burst I took an undergraduate internship with Sandia National Laboratories assisting with processes in their Computer Support Unit.</p>

<p>As an intern at Sandia opportunities kept arising for small programming tasks which refocused my university coursework on programming. As I took more programming classes, I began to look for opportunities at Sandia that would help enhance and develop my programming skills. When I started my master’s degree, I started a new Sandia internship developing small application components of a corporate application used to store information about computers, networks, and computer accounts. After earning my master’s degree from the Anderson Schools at the University of New Mexico I accepted a position as a member of Technical Staff at Sandia National Laboratories.</p>

<p>Once hired as a permanent member of staff my responsibilities rapidly increased from the design and implementation of small application components to large corporate application architecture, design and implementation. It was during the development of one such large application that I became acutely aware that my knowledge of software development could be improved. This realization led me on a journey of self-teaching, which while adequate in some ways, left me with the desire to learn much more regarding the intricacies of software engineering and led to my enrollment at Carnegie Mellon to earn a Master’s of Science in Software Engineering.</p>

<p>Sandia allowed me to apply the knowledge acquired at Carnegie Mellon by reshaping the way my team develops software. Over the course of a year I reshaped our haphazard development processes into the practices of Extreme Programming. During the first year utilizing this new methodology the team designed, developed and released four enterprise scale projects.</p>

<p>Professional success influenced by practical academics has shaped my outlook on software development. I have never stopped learning and am always interested in refining my development processes. For me it is not just the programming, all aspects of software development excite me.</p>

I enjoy video games, and I like helping people enjoy games as well.  </p>

<p>On top of all that, I co-author (with my partner in crime <a href=\"http://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/21619/ebongo\">EBongo</a>) a blog about gaming and technology called <a href=\"http://www.withoutthesarcasm.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Without the Sarcasm</a>.  </p>

<p>I am employed as a software engineer by a high performance media trader. There, I use Python, C++, Go, and AWS. </p>

<p>I like parsimonious code, with simple interfaces and excellent documentation. I'm not interested in enterprise, boiler-plate, or cookie-cutter nonsense. I oppose cruft and obfuscation. My favourite languages are C, Go and Python. I wish I was better at Haskell.</p>

<p>Years ago, I left home and joined the <a href=\"http://www.marines.mil/\" rel=\"nofollow\">United States Marine Corps</a> where I was assigned the Military Occupational Specialty of Basic Metal Worker (MOS 1316). I loved building things as a welder, but could not see myself doing this until I reached age 65.</p>

<p>After my Honorable Discharge in the early 1990s, I used my G.I. Bill to go to school and received my Bachelor of Science Degree in Physics four years later.</p>

<p>Using a love of computers since I played on a Commodore 64 at 10 years old and two (2) C++ electives that I had taken in school, I began working in the computer programming field.</p>

<p>The recession following ENRON in 2001 left me working at a remedial job for a little over two years while I brushed up on my skills at a local community college in SQL and first learned what the new .NET Framework was all about.</p>

<p>I have had the pleasure of working as a Software Developer since 2003.</p>

<p>For a short while, I pulled in a little extra income by running a moonlighting business under the name <a href=\"http://www.joeswelding.biz\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joe's Welding</a>. Dangerous working conditions and non-paying customers prompted me to sell my mobile welding equipment about the time my son was born.</p>

<p>Today, I am exclusively a Software Developer. My language of choice is C#, and I enjoy working with databases.</p>

<p>Where I am not known by my code, I am known by my motorcycle: I am one of the few riders who loves the Harley-Davidson XR1200. Pictures of my modified <code>XR</code> are posted on websites around the world, and I go by the screen name <a href=\"http://www.xr1200ownersgroup.com/site/member.php?913-JoeP\" rel=\"nofollow\">JoeP</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.xr1200ownersgroup.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">XR1200 Owner's Group</a>.</p>

<p>The majority of questions that I answer, I look up the answers and learn the subject with the asker.  This may make my information inexpert on occasion, but it means I always check my work for correctness and often provide references that I used to research.</p>

Been jumping between development and test since, and my niche is probably developing automated test frameworks and systems.  But I enjoy venturing into the unknown and trying new things and have worked in a variety of domains, from network communication to air traffic control to gaming platforms.

Also love my travelling and photography, and am getting into writing.</p>

<p>Just Another Genome Hacker,</p>

<p>Sadly, my most voted-up answer on Stackoverflow (312 votes) belonged to a question <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.hewgill.com/questions/242/068/9.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">that later got deleted.</a> The question came from a girl that asked for something cute that she could put on the icing of a birthday cake for her programmer boyfriend.</p>

<p>I suggested that, if her boyfriend is somewhat mathematically inclined, she write the following:</p>

<pre><code>    sin(t) ?|cos(t)|
r = __________________  - 2 sin(t) + 2
    sin(t) + 7/5
</code></pre>

<p>If he doesn't get it at first, she could tease him with saying that it is obvious that he should take the polar plot of it. If he still doesn't get it, she should tell him to enter it in <a href=\"http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=polar%20r=%28sin%28t%29%2asqrt%28abs%28cos%28t%29%29%29%29/%28sin%28t%29%20%2b%207/5%29%20-2%2asin%28t%29%20%2b%202\" rel=\"nofollow\">WolframAlpha</a>, that should yield the result:</p>

<p>Did I mention that I'm currently writing <a href=\"http://scenekitbook.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">a book</a> about <a href=\"/questions/tagged/scenekit\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;scenekit&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">scenekit</a>?</p>

<p>If you ask me questions over Twitter, be aware that I can't really fit much of an answer in just 140 characters.</p>

<p>I am the founder and CEO of <a href=\"http://www.nebulapro.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nebula Programming, LLC</a></p>

<p>I am a java programmer and Drupal web-developer.</p>

<p>I usually learn by picking up a book, reading it cover to cover, and then buying another book on the same subject which I never end up reading.</p>

<p>I own my own Dev-Server, Developed and published several websites including my most recent, <a href=\"http://www.masadaics.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">MasadaICS.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.masadatactical.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">MasadaTactical.com</a> <a href=\"http://www.masadahealth.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">MasadaProtection.com</a> [MasadaHealth.com][16] and worked on several, one of which, was <a href=\"http://mthtrains.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MTH Trains</a>.</p>

<p>I have also started working on crackmycode.com, since apparently <a href=\"http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com/a/4972/32110\">Stackexchange isn't interested</a></p>

<p>I have published 2 apps to the android market, which can be found <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Nebula+Programming+LLC\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>

<p>When I'm not programming, I'm teaching and training in <a href=\"http://www.masadaics.com/ics-and-krav-maga\" rel=\"nofollow\">Israeli Combat System</a> at <a href=\"http://www.masadaics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Masada Tactical</a>. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRc2jt00Sm0\" rel=\"nofollow\">We're famous</a> by the way!</p>

<p>In general, I'm a pretty awesome person (not Chuck Norris awesome, but sometimes I come pretty close)</p>

  <p>I'm just a single point on a complex plane. I'm not the strongest species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change. You can't teach me anything, but you can stimulate me to think! I am a detail-oriented analyst and interested in almost everything. Consistency, optimization, best-practice, &amp; perfection are always my first priority in mind! Therefore by my questions &amp; answers you'll fully recognize me. I can tell you more but then I have to kill you.</p>
  
  <p>I distribute my rep in bounties as spending money for my &amp; your pleasure is more meaningful than saving money in a bank &amp; abandoning it unused.</p>

<h2>Best practices</h2>

<ol>
<li>Use <code>pdflatex \\input{filename}</code> instead of <code>pdflatex filename</code>.</li>
<li>Don't specify the file extension in <code>\\includegraphics</code>.</li>
<li>Divide your project into a main &amp; smaller input files &amp; compile the main with <code>pdflatex</code>. </li>
<li>Put each code snippet 4 either drawing a diagram or making a table into a standalone input file &amp; compile it to produce a PDF.</li>
<li>Define global macros 4 often-used materials, put them into a separate package thereby changing the macros in one place will effect the whole document.</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary packages.</li>
<li>Don't mix different <strong>series</strong>, families, font size, &amp; <em>shapes</em>, <strong>ESPECIALLY</strong> <em>IN</em> <strong>ONE</strong> <em>SENTENCE</em>.</li>

Outside the USA I swam in rivers and lakes in Ethiopia, Egypt, and Brazil. Swimming in the Amazonas River, at the confluence of the Rio Negro (warm water) and the Solimoes (the main western branch of the Amazon River) with its cooler water, was my most exiting swimming experience. </p>

<p>I am a software engineer, mainly working on VPNs, SSL and IPSec based VPNs. I have been in these areas for a some time but still learning :). I like to solve problems, may not always be in software, but any kind of problems that can be logically solved. I love to ride my bike. I have a mountain bike which I take on trails in Mountain View. I recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon University, so took some time to settle down. Now will be starting to work soon.</p>

<p>I tutored other students in Fortran before PCs existed, built my first computer from bare circuit boards and reject parts (S-100 CP/M system), and transitioned from stereo repair, to professional audio manufacturing at Dolby Labs, where I set up the automated functional testing for Dolby professional equipment.  From there, I went into programming full-time as a C programmer for Mac presentation graphics systems, then to Windows C++ video programming.  My last 10 years was as a C++ Windows software engineer for a corporate source code control system.</p>

<p>I'm now a Linux user, doing part time website development using all open source tools like Vim, PHP, Javascript/jQuery, etc for local businesses.  I'm semi-retired, so I only do jobs that I want to do.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am your constant companion.</p>

<p>I am your greatest helper or heaviest burden.</p>

<p>I will push you onward or drag you down to failure.</p>

<p>I am completely at your command.</p>

<p>Half the things you do you might just as well turn over to me, and I will be able to do them quickly, correctly.</p>

<p>I am easily managed - you must merely be firm with me. Show me exactly how you want something done, and after a few lessons I will do it automatically.</p>

<p>I am the servant of all great people; and alas, of all failures as well. Those who are failures, I have made failures.</p>

<p>I am not a machine, though I work with all the precision of a machine plus the intelligence of a human being.</p>

<p>You may run me for a profit or turn me for ruin - it makes no difference to me.</p>

<p>Take me, train me, be firm with me, and I will place the world at your feet.</p>

<p>Be easy with me and I will destroy you.</p>

<p>Who am I?</p>

No, I don't think I'm smarter than Robert C. Martin.  I think that people who write the kind of code Mr Martin preaches don't need to resort to using \"cleaner\" as a bludgeon.

<p>superuser:  I got an Apple IIe at about 10 years of age. I became a computer gamer. Then you needed to know how to wiggle, jiggle, manipulate, and navigate all around a computer (at least software side) to get it to do what you wanted. I was motivated to learn and worked long and hard at it. Now, like many of you I am sure, I am the the go-to guy when it comes to fixing, tweaking, or simply using the potential of friends and neighbors computers.</p>

<p>I have done B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. Currently I am working as Assistant System Engineer for Tata Consultancy Services.</p>

<hr>

<p>When I am at work, I Love 3 things-</p>

<p><strong><em>Coding</em></strong>   ||   <strong><em>Cofee</em></strong>   ||   <strong><em>Interacting with Stack Exchange Community</em></strong></p>

<p><em>When I am not coding, I do play cricket, badminton, EA Sports, watch lot of movies. In my free time, I could be found hanging out with friends. I hate getting bored.</em> </p>

<h2>My quotes for life is:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I’d rather live with a good question than with a bad answer.</p></li>
<li><p>I own me, and therefore, I can engineer me. I am me, and I am okay. I never really look for anything. What God throws my way. I wake up in the morning and whichever way God turns my feet, I go.</p></li>
<li><p>I would love to help anyone, who might need a concern from me. So if you think, you can get something from my part, you are free to ask.</p></li>
</ul>

Unknowingly I had a brain tumor for many years before being diagnosed in 2010 with an orange-sized Anaplastic Astrocytoma. I endured 4 brain surgeries, 6 weeks chemo-radiotherapy and 10 months chemotherapy before getting back to what I love in 2012 when I launched <a href=\"http://thejarbar.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://thejarbar.org</a> and <a href=\"http://buhaugane.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://buhaugane.com</a></p>

<p>Oops 2012 and it happens again New tumor new surgery. Read about my life and support cancer (please) <a href=\"http://www.news24.com/MyNews24/Lack-of-brain-cancer-awareness-cost-me-Astrocytoma-20121011\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.news24.com/MyNews24/Lack-of-brain-cancer-awareness-cost-me-Astrocytoma-20121011</a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>No downvotes!</em></strong> I can't afford it anyways on my 5 per upvote wage.  The rich answerers have made sure that they start the world with all the advantages at an automatic 10 per upvote salary and that I the low born asker am bullied into submission with downvotes.  To be rich in rep is to be able to punish the weak askers.</li>
<li><strong><em>Only questions &amp; answers to my questions will be upvoted!!!</em></strong> I shall only act to assist my oppressed brothers &amp; sisters (and those that help me)!!!!  Helpful questions regardless of answers will be primarily upvoted.  Answerers who receive checks will also receive upvotes.</li>
<li><strong>Votes traded</strong>  I will upvote answers when I receive a question upvote and upvote questions when I get an upvoted answer.</li>
<li><strong>Vote priority</strong> If I hit the vote limit, checked answers to my questions will take priority then trades then questions.  The six question limit should prevent checked answers to my questions from being relevant, so 34 votes are almost guaranteed available for trade.</li>

I primarily work in <a href=\"/questions/tagged/php\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'php'\" rel=\"tag\">php</a>, <a href=\"/questions/tagged/javascript\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'javascript'\" rel=\"tag\">javascript</a> (<a href=\"/questions/tagged/jquery\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'jquery'\" rel=\"tag\">jquery</a>), <a href=\"/questions/tagged/html\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'html'\" rel=\"tag\">html</a>, <a href=\"/questions/tagged/css\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'css'\" rel=\"tag\">css</a>, <a href=\"/questions/tagged/perl\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'perl'\" rel=\"tag\">perl</a> and <a href=\"/questions/tagged/python\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'python'\" rel=\"tag\">python</a> but my favorite is PHP.</p>

<p>Several years ago I was the original creator of the <strong>PsychoStats</strong> open source project for Counter-Strike game servers. It was one of the most popular (if not <strong>the</strong> most popular) stats generation application for Counter-Strike servers. This software was my stepping stone into the world of Perl and PHP coding. I worked on the software for almost 11 years before I finally stopped developing for it.</p>

<p>These days I'm starting to dive into the world of <a href=\"/questions/tagged/android\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'android'\" rel=\"tag\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/tKsDb.png\" height=\"16\" width=\"18\" alt=\"\" class=\"sponsor-tag-img\">android</a> application and game development but I'm still in my infancy and have a long way to go before I create anything <em>cool</em> =)</p>

<p>I enjoy anime and watch tons of it, and currently I am reading much manga. I like to edit stuff and correct English, and I probably wash my hands too often but I don't have OCD (haha?). </p>

<p>In the future, I would like to become a Linguist (also known as a translator or interpretor). I would like to be able to translate between Japanese&lt;->English, Korean&lt;->English and Korean&lt;->Japanese. However, I think I'll try to learn more languages :)</p>

<p>Things I like doing are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Programming with Python</li>
<li>Japanese stuff. Korean stuff. Speaking it, living it, smelling it. (?)</li>
<li>Hacking when I can</li>
<li>Modding the Sims 3 and other programs</li>
<li>Messing with Ubuntu (and often for the worst)</li>
<li>Play Skyrim, Tekkit, Minecraft, Sims 3, Final Fantasy and other games</li>
<li>Geeking out</li>
<li>Manga (Koizora = my favourite)</li>
<li>Anime (Clannad, <strong><em>NANA</em></strong> and Reborn! being my absolute favourites) and</li>
<li>K-Pop. Because it's awesome.</li>
</ul>

<p>I work my way around, and am quite capable... but I still won't declare myself an expert yet :P</p>

<p>I am one of the few females around here, though I am admittedly on the verge of being a boy. I am fairly feminine in real life, but I play Skyrim, Final Fantasy and hack and mod. What does that make me?!</p>

<p>Anyway, sorry for the long bio, thanks for visiting and bye!</p>

I've been running linux on just about all my systems for over 5 years, and at least partially using it since '95, mostly with Debian and now Ubuntu.  Lately I'm getting back into a project using C, maybe Lua, front end with php/ajax/js, and who knows what else.</p>

<p>Outside of the techie stuff, I enjoy photography as a hobby and do a lot of home repair both on my own home and with the local Habitat chapter.  For fun, I strap the bare necessities onto my back and enjoy a weekend of backpacking.</p>

<p>I then spent 2 amazing years working at Outbrain , a cool start up that changes the way you read on the web (you just don’t even know you've already used it), and now I’m working as an NLP software engineer at Clearforest , a Thomson Reuters company , where I get the change to work with leading expert in the NLP world  and learn a bunch of new stuff (Whoo!)</p>

<p>I’ve always been fascinated by computer science – everything from machine learning algorithms via vision problems to the best way to manage concurrency in Java and debugging log files (that’s real programmers porn ). Currently I feel like StackOverflow is the best thing that happened since bread came sliced! </p>

<p>As Plutarch said – “The mind is a fire to be kindled , not a vessel to be filled.” . So far , I’ve never been cold.</p>

<p>Check out <a href=\"http://johnnycode.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">my blog: Johnny Code</a></p>

<p>Here are some of the technologies I've used:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Kentico - I'm a Kentico Certified Trainer, and avid developer.</li>
    <li>ASP.NET MVC - Worked on a college essay web application.</li>
    <li>Entity Framework -I've done multiple projects using EF and have come to like it.</li>
    <li>LINQ - I'd say I'm getting pretty good with LINQ.  I've also used LINQ to SQL on a couple projects.</li>
    <li>CMS': Kentico, Sitecore, Sitefinty, Ektron, and a little Drupal and Joomla.</li>
    <li>.NET controls: Telerik RAD controls</li>
    <li>Web Services - ASMX, ASP.NET Web API, WCF</li>
    <li>SQL - I've written more SQL than I'd like :P  Mostly for SQL Server and MySQL, but I wrote a little for Oracle too.</li>
    <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XHTML, XML, XSD - I can work with HTML and CSS fairly well, but I have NO design talent! But I could probably reproduce a Photoshop mockup with markup, and can slice and dice images fairly well.</li>
    <li>JavaScript - I was writing JavaScript before jQuery, but I never liked it :P  Now JavaScript is fun again.</li>

<p>Learn almost anything for free.</p>

<p>If you have any skill and like to teach, trust me, someone is wanting to learn from you right now, and in many cases, even willing to pay for it.</p>

<p>Last 1.9 year I made over 4565000rs./ $83,000 US selling one course alone (This One). In this course you'll learn with all detail exactly how I made that happen so you can do the same.</p>

<p>I have decided to make this training FREE. So All curious and skilled people can be trainer and say entrepreneur and make money and fame like khan academy, lynda.com, Pinal dave, www.hanselman.com  .Why I do charity because now I am satisfied with this amount of money. and I am planning to make new trainings to sale. </p>

<p>I will teach you how to create your own online course, make it look awesome, promote it, sell it, and make money with it.
Sounds good? </p>

<p>well here is exactly what we will cover:</p>

<p>Getting started: how to break down your course, all the tools you can use to create a course, and how to make it interesting so people actually listen!</p>

<p>Creating a great course: I'll teach you how to create a super cool presentation using Keynote</p>

<p>Recording your course: once you create your presentation you need to record it. I'll teach you how to use ScreenFlow for Mac to record your computer screen and yourself and how to edit it all together.</p>

<p>How to promote your course: once you have created your course it is time world know it exists! I'll teach you the most efficient ways to promote your course and find students.</p>

<p>Making money selling your course: how much to charge for your course? I'll teach you how to create a great sales page for your course, how to use PayPal to make money selling your course, finding affiliates, and much more!
Just like you I have invested zillions of dollars and many years educating myself, learning new skills. It's time to share that hard earned knowledge with the world and creating an online course is one of the best ways to do so, reach thousands of people and why not make some money on the side.</p>

<p>Are you ready? Let's do it!</p>

<p>Laziness: I’m too lazy to do the same task repeatedly so write scripts to do that task for me. This makes people think I am intelligent.</p>

<p>Impatience: I’m too impatient to wait for my code to run so rewrite the code to improve performance. This makes people think I am a good programmer.</p>

<p>Hubris: When someone asks if I can do something I just say Yes, then go find out how to do it (Google!). This makes people think I can do anything.</p>

<p>Ceramic collector, obsessive cook, entrepreneur and professional geek.</p>

<p>I was doing a one-person consultancy for a couple of years, doing some Rails stuff, some .Net services work, and some work in Groovy/Java for a pharmaceutical firm called Dendreon. When that project wrapped up, I took a Rails-focused job at a hybrid Ruby/C# shop, Getty Images.</p>

<p>I'm interested in functional languages like Scala and F# but have relatively limited real-world experience with them.</p>

<p>In previous lives, I've worked for Microsoft, Revenue Science (now Audience Science), Zillow, and a travel company called Virtuoso, the Seattle Times, and a very strange financial/transportation conglomerate.</p>

<p>My long term professional ambition is to find a way to work from Tokyo/Kawasaki/Yokohama either 100% or via frequent travel or remote work opportunities. If you're interested in tracking down a reasonably competent Rails or ASP.net MVC guy and are located near Seattle, WA or Tokyo, Japan or don't mind me working mostly remotely, feel free to contact me.</p>

<p>“Any code of your own that you haven't looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else. ” - Eagleson's law</p>

<p>“The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time. The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time. ” - Tom Cargill</p>

<p>\"To err is human... to really foul up requires the root password.\"</p>

<p>“Software sucks because users demand it to. ” - Nathan Myhrvold</p>

<p>\"Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.\" - Bill Gates</p>

<p>“It's hard enough to find an error in your code when you're looking for it; it's even harder when you've assumed your code is error-free. ” - Steve McConnell</p>

<p>“Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen. ” - Edward V Berard</p>

<p>“Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it. ” - Brian Kernighan</p>

My first programs were written using Microsoft QBasic on my old DOS PC. Around the same time, I took a summer course where I used Logo. I've been doing hobby programming at home in my free time ever since. I took two years of classes in high school, as well.</p>

<p>In 2004, I went off to college. On my first day, I bought a textbook on PHP and MySQL from the campus bookstore that was unrelated to any of my actual classes. Rather than going to class or doing any schoolwork, I read the book obsessively and dropped out. Ever since then, I've loved working with data driven applications.</p>

<p>Recently, I've been learning a LOT more about different database theories and techniques. With this learning I've found a new love for database design and I work with complex relational databases almost daily along with my hobby application development.</p>

<p>Professionally, I just started working for a technology company that focuses on social networking and eCommerce. At this company, my primary tasks have been working on website frontends using PHP and MySQL, although I hope to be moved to the backend someday.</p>

It was not love on first sight. I was still living the WYSIWYG illusion, and suffering a lot writing a microwave engineering thesis with the wrong tool (MicroSoft Word). In 1998, I finally learned my first mark-up language: HTML. </p>

<p>Around 2002 I discovered MS Word does not guarantee any backward compatibility for old Word documents with formulas. It took me until 2003 to pick up a German Markt+Technik book to get me started with LaTeX. I never looked back. The excellent LaTeX packaging system induced me also to look into GNU/Linux which became my only operating system since 2007.</p>

<p>Nowadays, AD 2013, I use LaTeX for all my document production needs, including Beamer presentations, curriculum vitae, letters, journal articles,... I am an isodoc contributor and I am currently developing a new document class for Belgian medical prescriptions. I also enjoy embedding Python code into LaTeX using Pweave.</p>

Immediately after, I started working at the company where I did my internship, <a href=\"http://aimproductions.be/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AIM Productions</a>. I liked the work and colleagues at the company too much to give up entirely for further studies, so I decided to combine the two. In 2009 I started studying for my master in Game and Media Technology at the <a href=\"http://www.uu.nl/EN/Pages/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">University of Utrecht</a> in the Netherlands and I graduated in 2012. Currently I'm a PhD student at the <a href=\"http://www.itu.dk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">IT University of Copenhagen</a>. As a member of the <a href=\"http://itu.dk/pit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pervasive Interaction Technology Lab (pIT Lab)</a>, I'm working on <a href=\"http://nexgsd.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Next Generation Technologies for Global Software Development (NeXGSD)</a> where I apply <a href=\"http://itu.dk/pit/abc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Activity-Based Computing (ABC)</a> principles throughout the lifecycle of software development to improve tool integration and improve knowledge transfer between coworkers.</p>

<p>I mainly develop in C#, but occasionally do C++, PHP, Flash/actionscript 3 and Java projects. I care a lot about proper code design, and some people tend to say I overdo it.</p>

<p>I am a former football player and boxer. I was a personal trainer - specialty was athletes - in my late teens and early 20s.  I have spent the last 15 years training mainly young athletes outside of my boring desk job.</p>

<p>When I answer a question it is because I have experience with the topic.  I am not looking at writing a term paper for you with references from scientific journals.  Often the studies in these journals happen in a bubble.  We do not live in a bubble. </p>

<p>Also from my experience I have one piece of advice - everyone is different, everyone reacts different to different training methods, everyone has their medical issues/vulnerabilities, everyone reacts different to diet plans, everyone has a the ability or inability to do certain things naturally, everyone has predisposed genetic traits that enable or hinder them from doing certain things.</p>

<p>Taught on 3.0, learned 3.5. DMed 3.5 for many years and love it still.</p>

<p>Favorite variants: Spell points, prestigious character classes, sorceror metamagic specialist, racial paragon classes, cloistered cleric, paladin of freedom, complex skill checks, weapon groups, craft points and summon monster variants.</p>

<p>Anyone playing in my game knows: Think outside the box, fear the rakshasa, demons are never your friend and a party that can't find traps will more often than not die by them.</p>

<p>Favorite DnD aspects: Roleplay and character personality development, long spanning adventures that convey useful things (tree of life, chakras... meaning), inventiveness and ingenuity.</p>

You think that gaming is a form of creative expression. You may view rules as, at best, a necessary evil, preferring sessions where the dice never come out of the bag. You enjoy situations that test or deepen your character's personality traits.</p>

I am neither especially clever nor especially gifted. I am only very, very curious. Hi, I’m Ashish Tanwer working as System software Engineer at ST Microelectronics. I have done my graduation in Electronics and Communication (2010) from Thapar University. The quote inspires me as I believe that we can intellectual pursuits by understanding the research and works created by notable thinkers of the past.</p>

<p>einstein-on-bikesIn my view, life is name of struggle and challenges and that is why it is beautiful. Let’s makes journey of life better and live with happiness and feel happy. Let’s say life you are the love of my life and make life happy. I take risks and enjoy every moment of my life. I welcome challenges and fight with full of my power.</p>

<p>“Life is like a bicycle, to keep your balance your must keep on moving.”</p>

<p>I sincerely believe that God has assigned everyone a NOBLE purpose. It is our duty to find it and do it. Let’s dedicate our lives for the NOBLE purpose. Remember, the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength, not a lack of knowledge, but rather a lack in will. The failure is the stepping stone for success. And so keep trying and NEVER EVER give up.</p>

<p>I am open to everyone who is doing a great task, want to work for good, have a novel idea or searching a right direction.</p>

<p>I have an android mobile and work on ubuntu currently. 
My favourite languages are python, java and php. Though I don't have more than a few months' active experience in Java, I'd love to start working with it in the industry.
I'm still learning lots of other languages, apis, tools and tricks about computers, networking and the internet, as all programmers do.</p>

My first experience was with Vampire The Masquerade and then a bit of 3.5 D&amp;D. I didn't fully get into the hobby until 2012 when a friend started a 4e campaign and invited me to play and I dove in. I currently play 4e, 13th Age, Savage Worlds and Colonial Marines. I try to read up on as many RPG mechanics as I can and look forward to trying more RPGs in the future.</p>

<p>My background before RPGs comes from video games, board games, and war games before I played RPGs. </p>

I will never believe any insult thrown at me. No matter what others say or think, I'm someone nobody else can be, I'm me! I'm one and unique in this world.</p>

<p>Javed Ahmed is a software engineer. Javed Ahmed has a B.E in Computer Sciences from Visveswariah Technological University (2007)</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>1)Believe in yourself as much as possible. You are going to meet people who will emotionally tear you apart, people who will tell you \"you can't do it\" or talk back of you \"He can't do it\". But believe it you are lot stronger then someones opinion. You are who you are, make the best of it. Because love is louder then hate.</p>

<p>2)If people talk behind your back then it's like they are eating flesh of a dead body.</p>

I'm now a martial artist with several styles under my belt, specializing in Traditional Chinese Kungfu and Taiji, and very interested in fitness that drives full-body health and positive mental and emotional development.  In recent years I've also picked up Freediving, done some spearfishing, and worked my way up to a solid intermediate player in underwater hockey.  This year I'm also trying to learn rock-climbing -- I have a long way to go, but my excellent overall fitness and the core-muscle and balance skills I gained from martial arts and swimming have given me a really good head-start.  </p>

<p>I'm 35 and in the best shape of my life by far.  I weigh 125 pounds, have nice visible muscles without being skinny (I've always been curvy and I like it that way), and while I'm always looking to get stronger, faster, more flexible and more unstoppable, I also put a lot of focus on avoiding injury and making sure my later years are just as filled with awesome as the last ten have been!</p>

<p>Fitness is a habit just like anything else!  If I can go from never-exercised, sat-indoors-all-day to where I am now, anybody can get there.  And I'm thrilled if I can help.</p>

Yes, <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">beauty is not relative.</a> Particularly, this means that I do not accept bullshit.

<p>It seems to me that the idiocy is amplified by <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fluff Principle</a> here. I consider Stackexchange a best place for challenging the assumptions in popular beliefs. But, I see that people, who are unable to listen, practice ostracism. The bigots from all over the world confer to ignore my argument and preach what they know, the simple minded beliefs. For instance, <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19952551/why-dont-we-have-intdelta-a-qustin-about-timedelta\">why don't we have spacedelta</a> in python, <a href=\"http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/384927/why-direction-makes-difference-between-scalars-and-vectors\">why direction makes difference between scalars and vectors</a>, <a href=\"http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/63534\">conductor must gain charge when electrons are set into motion</a>, <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9132178\">what is the point of accept method in visitor pattern</a>. These are all cases where I ask to argue for the fundamental basics and all are massively downvoted. People hate to know why popular things are like they are! This is bigotry. Or overprotect me(e.g <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19712395\">saying that macros are evil</a>). </p>

<p>Stackoverflow: Debugging means localizing the bug. In 99.9% debugging exposes the bug and it is not a subject of StackOverflow. StackOverflow can only be useful if you describe some weirdness and do it very clearly. You say: here is A and therefore must be B. But I do not see it. What is a problem? The code snippet must be no longer than necessary to expose the problem. When user posts his program awhole, he demonstrates that he made no attempt to localize the bug.</p>

I try to keep the information global and using an appropriate langage in relation to the asker(s) aptitude and position. I try to find the behind-the-appearance real cause for a failure/breach/suspicious activity.</p>

<p>In programming, I place portability above all, having to use very old systems where GNU niceties and \"common\" taken-for-granted features are absent (ex: tar's removal of the leading \"/\" when extracting files...). I prefer simple to read answers to clever one-liners, especially when the asker seems a beginner.</p>

<p>In Photography, I try to keep it as close to the subject as possible (spontaneous portraits, lack of (or very minimal) editing), and trying to get a global view of the field to find interresting solutions to everyday situations.</p>

The computer had only LEDs and pushbutton type switches for output and input. Next I splurged and made a Big Board computer with all of 64K in RAM, a real keyboard, a real CRT, and a couple of 8-inch floppy disks. I taught myself to program in C. Not being anything close to a full-time programmer, rapid shifts between computer systems and operating systems eventually exceeded my ability to keep up. However, I approach understanding computers with experience that goes all the way back to debugging mis-connected wire-wrapped terminals, semi-functioning chips in the Big Board, etc. In other words, I may have a more tactile understanding of some things that are abstractions that play nicely with logic to those who started with a super computer in a box.</p>

<p><strong>Philosophy:</strong>  I believe in life-long education such as that gained through the research I perform to give great answers on Stack Exchange.  </p>

<p><strong>Primary Interests</strong>: Cognitive psychology, linguistics, personal and cultural identity, theory of humor, and Education.  <strong>Other Interests:</strong>  Ballroom Dancing, Autism and Savant Syndrome (esp Absolute Pitch, which I have no sense of), Philosophy, Theory and History of Math, Theory and History of Science, Writing, Humor, Music, Piano, Singing (esp.

<p><strong>Philosophy on Dealing with Negativity:  Practice for Fame and Fortune by Ignoring Negativity!</strong>  </p>

<p>Think of negativity as a great, fun opportunity to ready yourself for a life of fame. Famous people have to ignore vast amounts of negativity about them. If they didn't, they would forever be wasting their time apologizing, defending theirselves, or crying foul to people in charge. </p>

<p>Do you find yourself getting worked up over one little comment?  Think about it this way: Even if they wanted to, a famous person couldn't read all the bad things about them. They would have to hire an entire, full-time staff of a hundred people to read, get upset, and respond to all the stuff written about them.  Start practicing now so when you get famous, you don't have to hire a hundred people to get upset for you.</p>

<p>The key is really to think of negativity as just \"part of the game\". Like Tetris, The Legend of Zelda, or PAC-MAN.  You just step around it.  Keep moving ahead.  Don't look back at that thing you stepped around.  Stop that.  Stop lookihg back.  Are you looking back?  POW you lost the level because you were looking back.  Did you learn?  Stop looking back at \"that thing\" you stepped around.</p>

<p><strong>About Me</strong> </p>

<p>Taught myself programming in 7th grade from my older brother's math book before I had a computer (1978).  I would run the programs on paper to see what they would do.  I learned to program for joy from then until the end of college.</p>

<p>I work at PNC bank as a Software Engineer SR.</p>

<p>Once upon a time I worked in a factory to pay for my CS degree.  I was promoted several times into engineering and then into engineering management.  To switch back to my goal of a computer programming became expensive - upper end engineering salary vs mid level programmer. So I wrote code to automate engineering processes (\"Expert System\" if you will).  Then one day I made an executive decision and made the career change and have been happier but poorer since.</p>

<p>Under Promise / Over Deliver! ~Always<br></p>

<p>Always be aware of the balance in your ass' bank account. Never cut checks for the full amount.<br></p>

<p>I'm also a huge Gamer Otaku with a paranoia which compels me to buy 2 of any figure or something i can duplicate easily and store 1 for stately</p>

<p>in terms of genre's in anime and games i don't have too much of a preference just as long as it has a good store and good mechanics (games), ofcause this tends to make me lean towards RPG Games as i have a huge collection of them already</p>

I'm here for the coding and to mingle with my fellow keyboard mashers. 
Python, R and Java are my languages of study. Python-ites convinced me that the sky was the limit, R because I like playing with numbers and Java because at some point, EVERY Android geek wants to try his/her hand at app development.</p>

<p>I'm a third year undergrad student majoring in Computer Information Systems and minoring in Psychology (neat combo, huh?). I'm currently at the helm of my second psych study, delving into the nuance of hemispheric communication and decision making. </p>

<p>One of my passions is fitness. In the past year I have lost 91 pounds and fallen in love with cycling and more recently running.</p>

Having struggled with her own weight and fitness, she understands how hard the battle can be, and the importance of every victory, large or small. </p>

<p>She loves the mind-body connection fostered by activities like yoga and belly dance, and deeply mistrusts shoes that have been \"engineered.\"  Her philosophy is that getting fit should mean getting in touch with your body, and learning to love all that it does for you right now, as well as what it may do for you in the future.</p>

<p>In edition to her work as a fitness professional, Shannon is an accomplished burlesque dancer, improvisor, and storyteller.  She pulls from her experiences both on and off stage to help her clients build confidence and live their lives to the fullest.</p>

My name is Sean Marchetti and I'm a software engineer living in the New York City metropolitan area. I graduated from the University of Vermont and I've been working professionally in the software engineering field for over a decade.</p>

<p>I enjoy creating and developing great products. I've been fortunate enough to work with some amazing companies and I've gained a lot of experience with the entire software development lifecycle.</p>

<p>I am especially interested in continuous integration and creating a frictionless development process. I feel that freeing developers from the shackles of building, testing and deployment, unlocks tremendous creativity and empowerment.</p>

<p>I like to stay fit and I'm an active member of the Crossfit community. I am also a musician and try to play as often as possible. Back in the day, I used to play in a band called the Groove Components.</p>

<p>CLAIMER: </p>

<p>I'm a long-time IBMer, having worked on the IBM and Apache XML/XPath/XSLT code and been involved in some of the W3C efforts (DOM Working group primarily but that interacted with some of the others). I've contributed at least one article to IBM's DeveloperWorks website. More recently I've been working on the back-end code of the WebSphere Application Server, mostly the Liberty profile. </p>

<p>Feel free to consider me biased in favor of IBM -- and even more biased in favor of industry standards, whenever possible -- but I make every attempt to be fair and honest.</p>
